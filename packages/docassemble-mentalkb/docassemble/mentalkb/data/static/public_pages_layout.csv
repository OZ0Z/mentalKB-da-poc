5586,,General,CustodyAgreements,LongText,2,,,The best way to create a Parenting Plan and Custody Agreement is when both parents work together to determine what is best for the children.  When one parent refuses to cooperate or sign off on a Plan or Agreement the other parent must go it alone. That parent should know that judges prefer both parents share parenting and custody responsibilities and the parent who submits the most  appropriate Plan and Agreement will receive the judge's approval. ,,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the difficult times and challenges we lived through over the years, our heart connection continues even when we are apart.\n\nLike the dynamic of all parent-child relationships, in some ways I represent the father inside Drew and in some ways he represents the child inside me. Sometimes I am the teacher and Drew is the student, while other times Drew is the teacher and I am the student.\n\nOur shared commitment to fairness and justice&#151;speaking on behalf of those without a voice&#151;has been a catalyst for me in bringing KidsFirst! into reality. Compassion, love, and understanding for those who act out of fear instead of love, especially for those closest to us, remain our greatest and most honorable teacher.\n\nHenry Koltys\nJuly 4, 2007",,left,header,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2656,General,General,CustodyAgreements,LongText,7,,,"How many plans you should create depends upon whether one plan would fit for all children or whether separate plans would make it easier to parent your children. You may want to treat your children differently because of gender, wide differences in age or special needs like a physical or mental disability so creating a separate plan makes sense. If one or more child will be raised differently than the others, think about whether it makes sense to create a separate agreement for each child. \n\nFor example, if you have three children, you could create a single agreement for all three or you could create two agreements, one for the older children and one for the youngest child, or you could create three separate agreements, one for each child.   If there will be only minor differences you may create one plan and then make the changes by editing the final documents.\n\nIMPORTANT: Know that if you decide to create more than one plan each report will only include the children listed in that plan not children in different reports. This means if you have one plan for your son and a different plan for your daughter, each report will be specific for each child and the information will not be combined into one report. You may, however, cut and paste each report into a text document to combine both reports.",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6510,,LawOpinionsResearch,OpinionSCOTUS,LongText,16,,,"PRICE WATERHOUSE v. HOPKINS, 490 U.S. 228 (1989)\n490 U.S. 228\nPRICE WATERHOUSE v. HOPKINS \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF \nCOLUMBIA CIRCUIT \nNo. 87-1167. \n\nArgued October 31, 1988 \nDecided May 1, 1989 \nRespondent was a senior manager in an office of petitioner professional accounting partnership when she was proposed for partnership in 1982. She was neither offered nor denied partnership but instead her candidacy was held for reconsideration the following year. When the partners in her office later refused to repropose her for partnership, she sued petitioner in Federal District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, charging that it had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its partnership decisions. The District Court ruled in respondent's favor on the question of liability, holding that petitioner had unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners' comments about her that resulted from sex stereotyping. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Both courts held that an employer who has allowed a discriminatory motive to play a part in an employment decision must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination, and that petitioner had not carried this burden.\nHeld:\nThe judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n263 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 825 F.2d 458, reversed and remanded.\nJUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded that when a plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that her gender played a part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff's gender into account. The courts below erred by requiring petitioner to make its proof by clear and convincing evidence. Pp. 237-258.\n(a) The balance between employee rights and employer prerogatives established by Title VII by eliminating certain bases for distinguishing among employees while otherwise preserving employers' freedom of choice is decisive in this case. The words ""because of"" in 703(a)(1) of the Act, which forbids an employer to make an adverse decision against an employee ""because of such individual's . . . sex,"" requires looking at all of the reasons, both legitimate and illegitimate, contributing to the decision at the time it is made. The preservation of employers' freedom of choice means that an employer will not be liable if it can prove that, if [490 U.S. 228, 229]   it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision. This Court's prior decisions demonstrate that the plaintiff who shows that an impermissible motive played a motivating part in an adverse employment decision thereby places the burden on the defendant to show that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the unlawful motive. Here, petitioner may not meet its burden by merely showing that respondent's interpersonal problems - abrasiveness with staff members - constituted a legitimate reason for denying her partnership; instead, petitioner must show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced petitioner to deny respondent partnership. Pp. 239-252.\n(b) Conventional rules of civil litigation generally apply in Title VII cases, and one of these rules is that the parties need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence. Pp. 252-255.\n(c) The District Court's finding that sex stereotyping was permitted to play a part in evaluating respondent as a candidate for partnership was not clearly erroneous. This finding is not undermined by the fact that many of the suspect comments made about respondent were made by partners who were supporters rather than detractors. Pp. 255-258.\nJUSTICE WHITE, although concluding that the Court of Appeals erred in requiring petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reached the same employment decision in the absence of the improper motive, rather than merely requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence as in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 , which sets forth the proper approach to causation in this case, also concluded that the plurality here errs in seeming to require, at least in most cases, that the employer carry its burden by submitting objective evidence that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. In a mixed-motives case, where the legitimate motive found would have been ample grounds for the action taken, and the employer credibly testifies that the action would have been taken for the legitimate reasons alone, this should be ample proof, and there is no special requirement of objective evidence. This would even more plainly be the case where the employer denies any illegitimate motive in the first place but the court finds that illegitimate, as well as legitimate, factors motivated the adverse action. Pp. 258-261.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR, although agreeing that on the facts of this case, the burden of persuasion should shift to petitioner to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision absent consideration of respondent's gender, and that this burden shift is properly part of the liability phase of the litigation, concluded that the plurality misreads Title VII's substantive causation requirement to command burden shifting if the employer's decisional process is [490 U.S. 228, 230]   ""tainted"" by awareness of sex or race in any way, and thereby effectively eliminates the requirement. JUSTICE O'CONNOR also concluded that the burden shifting rule should be limited to cases such as the present in which the employer has created uncertainty as to causation by knowingly giving substantial weight to an impermissible criterion. Pp. 261-279.\n(a) Contrary to the plurality's conclusion, Title VII's plain language making it unlawful for an employer to undertake an adverse employment action ""because of"" prohibited factors and the statute's legislative history demonstrate that a substantive violation only occurs when consideration of an illegitimate criterion is the ""but-for"" cause of the adverse action. However, nothing in the language, history, or purpose of the statute prohibits adoption of an evidentiary rule which places the burden of persuasion on the defendant to demonstrate that legitimate concerns would have justified an adverse employment action where the plaintiff has convinced the factfinder that a forbidden factor played a substantial role in the employment decision. Such a rule has been adopted in tort and other analogous types of cases, where leaving the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove ""but-for"" causation would be unfair or contrary to the deterrent purposes embodied in the concept of duty of care. Pp. 262-269.\n(b) Although the burden shifting rule adopted here departs from the careful framework established by McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 , and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,450 U.S. 248 - which clearly contemplate that an individual disparate treatment plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion throughout the litigation - that departure is justified in cases such as the present where the plaintiff, having presented direct evidence that the employer placed substantial, though unquantifiable, reliance on a forbidden factor in making an employment decision, has taken her proof as far as it could go, such that it is appropriate to require the defendant, which has created the uncertainty as to causation by considering the illegitimate criterion, to show that its decision would have been justified by wholly legitimate concerns. Moreover, a rule shifting the burden in these circumstances will not conflict with other Title VII policies, particularly its prohibition on preferential treatment based on prohibited factors. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 , distinguished. Pp. 270-276.\n(c) Thus, in order to justify shifting the burden on the causation issue to the defendant, a disparate treatment plaintiff must show by direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision. Such a showing entitles the factfinder to presume that the employer's discriminatory animus made a difference in the outcome, and, if the employer fails to carry its burden of persuasion, to conclude that the employer's decision was made ""because of"" consideration of the illegitimate factor, thereby satisfying [490 U.S. 228, 231]   the substantive standard for liability under Title VII. This burden shifting rule supplements the McDonnell Douglas-Burdine framework, which continues to apply where the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the threshold standard set forth herein.

She was neither offered nor denied admission to the partnership; instead, her candidacy was held for reconsideration the following year. When the partners in her office later refused[490 U.S. 228, 232]   to repropose her for partnership, she sued Price Waterhouse under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq., charging that the firm had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its decisions regarding partnership. Judge Gesell in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in her favor on the question of liability, 618 F. Supp. 1109 (1985), and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. 263 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 825 F.2d 458 (1987). We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the respective burdens of proof of a defendant and plaintiff in a suit under Title VII when it has been shown that an employment decision resulted from a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives. 485 U.S. 933 (1988).\nI\nAt Price Waterhouse, a nationwide professional accounting partnership, a senior manager becomes a candidate for partnership when the partners in her local office submit her name as a candidate. All of the other partners in the firm are then invited to submit written comments on each candidate - either on a ""long"" or a ""short"" form, depending on the partner's degree of exposure to the candidate. Not every partner in the firm submits comments on every candidate. After reviewing the comments and interviewing the partners who submitted them, the firm's Admissions Committee makes a recommendation to the Policy Board. This recommendation will be either that the firm accept the candidate for partnership, put her application on ""hold,"" or deny her the promotion outright. The Policy Board then decides whether to submit the candidate's name to the entire partnership for a vote, to ""hold"" her candidacy, or to reject her. The recommendation of the Admissions Committee, and the decision of the Policy Board, are not controlled by fixed guidelines: a certain number of positive comments from partners will not guarantee a candidate's admission to the partnership, nor will a specific [490 U.S. 228, 233]   quantity of negative comments necessarily defeat her application. Price Waterhouse places no limit on the number of persons whom it will admit to the partnership in any given year.\nAnn Hopkins had worked at Price Waterhouse's Office of Government Services in Washington, D.C., for five years when the partners in that office proposed her as a candidate for partnership. Of the 662 partners at the firm at that time, 7 were women. Of the 88 persons proposed for partnership that year, only 1 - Hopkins - was a woman. Forty-seven of these candidates were admitted to the partnership, 21 were rejected, and 20 - including Hopkins - were ""held"" for reconsideration the following year. 1Thirteen of the 32 partners who had submitted comments on Hopkins supported her bid for partnership. Three partners recommended that her candidacy be placed on hold, eight stated that they did not have an informed opinion about her, and eight recommended that she be denied partnership.\nIn a jointly prepared statement supporting her candidacy, the partners in Hopkins' office showcased her successful 2-year effort to secure a $25 million contract with the Department of State, labeling it ""an outstanding performance"" and one that Hopkins carried out ""virtually at the partner level."" Plaintiff's Exh. 15. Despite Price Waterhouse's attempt at trial to minimize her contribution to this project, Judge Gesell [490 U.S. 228, 234]   specifically found that Hopkins had ""played a key role in Price Waterhouse's successful effort to win a multi-million dollar contract with the Department of State."" 618 F. Supp., at 1112. Indeed, he went on, ""[n]one of the other partnership candidates at Price Waterhouse that year had a comparable record in terms of successfully securing major contracts for the partnership."" Ibid.\nThe partners in Hopkins' office praised her character as well as her accomplishments, describing her in their joint statement as ""an outstanding professional"" who had a ""deft touch,"" a ""strong character, independence and integrity."" Plaintiff's Exh. 15. Clients appear to have agreed with these assessments. At trial, one official from the State Department described her as ""extremely competent, intelligent,"" ""strong and forthright, very productive, energetic and creative."" Tr. 150. Another high-ranking official praised Hopkins' decisiveness, broadmindedness, and ""intellectual clarity""; she was, in his words, ""a stimulating conversationalist."" Id., at 156-157. Evaluations such as these led Judge Gesell to conclude that Hopkins ""had no difficulty dealing with clients and her clients appear to have been very pleased with her work"" and that she ""was generally viewed as a highly competent project leader who worked long hours, pushed vigorously to meet deadlines and demanded much from the multidisciplinary staffs with which she worked."" 618 F. Supp., at 1112-1113.\nOn too many occasions, however, Hopkins' aggressiveness apparently spilled over into abrasiveness. Staff members seem to have borne the brunt of Hopkins' brusqueness. Long before her bid for partnership, partners evaluating her work had counseled her to improve her relations with staff members. Although later evaluations indicate an improvement, Hopkins' perceived shortcomings in this important area eventually doomed her bid for partnership. Virtually all of the partners' negative remarks about Hopkins - even those of partners supporting her - had to do with her ""interpersonal [490 U.S. 228, 235]   skills."" Both ""[s]upporters and opponents of her candidacy,"" stressed Judge Gesell, ""indicated that she was sometimes overly aggressive, unduly harsh, difficult to work with and impatient with staff."" Id., at 1113.\nThere were clear signs, though, that some of the partners reacted negatively to Hopkins' personality because she was a woman. One partner described her as ""macho"" (Defendant's Exh. 30); another suggested that she ""overcompensated for being a woman"" (Defendant's Exh. 31); a third advised her to take ""a course at charm school"" (Defendant's Exh. 27). Several partners criticized her use of profanity; in response, one partner suggested that those partners objected to her swearing only ""because it's a lady using foul language."" Tr. 321. Another supporter explained that Hopkins ""ha[d] matured from a tough-talking somewhat masculine hard-nosed mgr to an authoritative, formidable, but much more appealing lady ptr candidate."" Defendant's Exh. 27. But it was the man who, as Judge Gesell found, bore responsibility for explaining to Hopkins the reasons for the Policy Board's decision to place her candidacy on hold who delivered the coup de grace: in order to improve her chances for partnership, Thomas Beyer advised, Hopkins should ""walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."" 618 F. Supp., at 1117.\nDr. Susan Fiske, a social psychologist and Associate Professor of Psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University, testified at trial that the partnership selection process at Price Waterhouse was likely influenced by sex stereotyping. Her testimony focused not only on the overtly sex-based comments of partners but also on gender-neutral remarks, made by partners who knew Hopkins only slightly, that were intensely critical of her. One partner, for example, baldly stated that Hopkins was ""universally disliked"" by staff (Defendant's Exh. 27), and another described her as ""consistently annoying and irritating"" (ibid.); yet these were people who had had very little contact with Hopkins. According to[490 U.S. 228, 236]   Fiske, Hopkins' uniqueness (as the only woman in the pool of candidates) and the subjectivity of the evaluations made it likely that sharply critical remarks such as these were the product of sex stereotyping - although Fiske admitted that she could not say with certainty whether any particular comment was the result of stereotyping. Fiske based her opinion on a review of the submitted comments, explaining that it was commonly accepted practice for social psychologists to reach this kind of conclusion without having met any of the people involved in the decisionmaking process.\nIn previous years, other female candidates for partnership also had been evaluated in sex-based terms. As a general matter, Judge Gesell concluded, ""[c]andidates were viewed favorably if partners believed they maintained their femin[in]ity while becoming effective professional managers""; in this environment, ""[t]o be identified as a `women's lib[b]er' was regarded as [a] negative comment."" 618 F. Supp., at 1117. In fact, the judge found that in previous years ""[o]ne partner repeatedly commented that he could not consider any woman seriously as a partnership candidate and believed that women were not even capable of functioning as senior managers - yet the firm took no action to discourage his comments and recorded his vote in the overall summary of the evaluations."" Ibid.\nJudge Gesell found that Price Waterhouse legitimately emphasized interpersonal skills in its partnership decisions, and also found that the firm had not fabricated its complaints about Hopkins' interpersonal skills as a pretext for discrimination. Moreover, he concluded, the firm did not give decisive emphasis to such traits only because Hopkins was a woman; although there were male candidates who lacked these skills but who were admitted to partnership, the judge found that these candidates possessed other, positive traits that Hopkins lacked.\nThe judge went on to decide, however, that some of the partners' remarks about Hopkins stemmed from an impermissibly [490 U.S. 228, 237]   cabined view of the proper behavior of women, and that Price Waterhouse had done nothing to disavow reliance on such comments. He held that Price Waterhouse had unlawfully discriminated against Hopkins on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners' comments that resulted from sex stereotyping. Noting that Price Waterhouse could avoid equitable relief by proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have placed Hopkins' candidacy on hold even absent this discrimination, the judge decided that the firm had not carried this heavy burden.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ultimate conclusion, but departed from its analysis in one particular: it held that even if a plaintiff proves that discrimination played a role in an employment decision, the defendant will not be found liable if it proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination. 263 U.S. App. D.C., at 333-334, 825 F.2d, at 470-471. Under this approach, an employer is not deemed to have violated Title VII if it proves that it would have made the same decision in the absence of an impermissible motive, whereas under the District Court's approach, the employer's proof in that respect only avoids equitable relief. We decide today that the Court of Appeals had the better approach, but that both courts erred in requiring the employer to make its proof by clear and convincing evidence.\nII\nThe specification of the standard of causation under Title VII is a decision about the kind of conduct that violates that statute. According to Price Waterhouse, an employer violates Title VII only if it gives decisive consideration to an employee's gender, race, national origin, or religion in making a decision that affects that employee. On Price Waterhouse's theory, even if a plaintiff shows that her gender played a part in an employment decision, it is still her burden to show that the decision would have been different if the employer had [490 U.S. 228, 238]   not discriminated. In Hopkins' view, on the other hand, an employer violates the statute whenever it allows one of these attributes to play any part in an employment decision. Once a plaintiff shows that this occurred, according to Hopkins, the employer's proof that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination can serve to limit equitable relief but not to avoid a finding of liability. 2 We conclude that, as often happens, the truth lies somewhere in between. [490 U.S. 228, 239]  \nA\nIn passing Title VII, Congress made the simple but momentous announcement that sex, race, religion, and national origin are not relevant to the selection, evaluation, or compensation of employees. 3 Yet, the statute does not purport to limit the other qualities and characteristics that employers may take into account in making employment decisions. The converse, therefore, of ""for cause"" legislation, 4Title VII eliminates certain bases for distinguishing among employees while otherwise preserving employers' freedom of choice. This balance between employee rights and employer prerogatives turns out to be decisive in the case before us.\nCongress' intent to forbid employers to take gender into account in making employment decisions appears on the face of the statute. In now-familiar language, the statute forbids [490 U.S. 228, 240]   an employer to ""fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,"" or to ""limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's . . . sex."" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1), (2) (emphasis added). 5 We take these words to mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions. To construe the words ""because of"" as colloquial shorthand for ""but-for causation,"" as does Price Waterhouse, is to misunderstand them. 6  \nBut-for causation is a hypothetical construct. In determining whether a particular factor was a but-for cause of a given event, we begin by assuming that that factor was present at the time of the event, and then ask whether, even if that factor had been absent, the event nevertheless would have transpired in the same way. The present, active tense of the operative verbs of 703(a)(1) (""to fail or refuse""), in contrast, turns our attention to the actual moment of the [490 U.S. 228, 241]   event in question, the adverse employment decision. The critical inquiry, the one commanded by the words of 703(a)(1), is whether gender was a factor in the employment decision at the moment it was made. Moreover, since we know that the words ""because of"" do not mean ""solely because of,"" 7 we also know that Title VII meant to condemn even those decisions based on a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate considerations. When, therefore, an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was ""because of"" sex and the other, legitimate considerations - even if we may say later, in the context of litigation, that the decision would have been the same if gender had not been taken into account.\nTo attribute this meaning to the words ""because of"" does not, as the dissent asserts, post, at 282, divest them of causal significance. A simple example illustrates the point. Suppose two physical forces act upon and move an object, and suppose that either force acting alone would have moved the object. As the dissent would have it, neither physical force was a ""cause"" of the motion unless we can show that but for one or both of them, the object would not have moved; apparently both forces were simply ""in the air"" unless we can identify at least one of them as a but-for cause of the object's movement. Ibid. Events that are causally overdetermined, in other words, may not have any ""cause"" at all. This cannot be so.\nWe need not leave our common sense at the doorstep when we interpret a statute. It is difficult for us to imagine that, in the simple words ""because of,"" Congress meant to obligate a plaintiff to identify the precise causal role played by legitimate and illegitimate motivations in the employment decision she challenges. We conclude, instead, that Congress meant [490 U.S. 228, 242]   to obligate her to prove that the employer relied upon sex-based considerations in coming to its decision.\nOur interpretation of the words ""because of"" also is supported by the fact that Title VII does identify one circumstance in which an employer may take gender into account in making an employment decision, namely, when gender is a ""bona fide occupational qualification [(BFOQ)] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of th[e] particular business or enterprise."" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(e). The only plausible inference to draw from this provision is that, in all other circumstances, a person's gender may not be considered in making decisions that affect her. Indeed, Title VII even forbids employers to make gender an indirect stumbling block to employment opportunities. An employer may not, we have held, condition employment opportunities on the satisfaction of facially neutral tests or qualifications that have a disproportionate, adverse impact on members of protected groups when those tests or qualifications are not required for performance of the job. See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 (1988); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971).\nTo say that an employer may not take gender into account is not, however, the end of the matter, for that describes only one aspect of Title VII. The other important aspect of the statute is its preservation of an employer's remaining freedom of choice. We conclude that the preservation of this freedom means that an employer shall not be liable if it can prove that, even if it had not taken gender into account, it would have come to the same decision regarding a particular person. The statute's maintenance of employer prerogatives is evident from the statute itself and from its history, both in Congress and in this Court.\nTo begin with, the existence of the BFOQ exception shows Congress' unwillingness to require employers to change the very nature of their operations in response to the statute. And our emphasis on ""business necessity"" in disparate-impact [490 U.S. 228, 243]   cases, see Watson and Griggs, and on ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason[s]"" in disparate-treatment cases, see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973); Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), results from our awareness of Title VII's balance between employee rights and employer prerogatives. In McDonnell Douglas, we described as follows Title VII's goal to eradicate discrimination while preserving workplace efficiency: ""The broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer, is efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and racially neutral employment and personnel decisions. In the implementation of such decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no racial discrimination, subtle or otherwise."" 411 U.S., at 801 .\nWhen an employer ignored the attributes enumerated in the statute, Congress hoped, it naturally would focus on the qualifications of the applicant or employee. The intent to drive employers to focus on qualifications rather than on race, religion, sex, or national origin is the theme of a good deal of the statute's legislative history. An interpretive memorandum entered into the Congressional Record by Senators Case and Clark, comanagers of the bill in the Senate, is representative of this general theme. 8According to their memorandum, Title VII ""`expressly protects the employer's right to insist that any prospective applicant, Negro or white, must meet the applicable job qualifications. Indeed, the very purpose of title VII is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color.'"" 9 110 Cong. Rec. 7247 (1964) quoted in Griggs v. [490 U.S. 228, 244]   Duke Power Co., supra, at 434. The memorandum went on: ""To discriminate is to make a distinction, to make a difference in treatment or favor, and those distinctions or differences in treatment or favor which are prohibited by section 704 are those which are based on any five of the forbidden criteria: race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Any other criterion or qualification for employment is not affected by this title."" 110 Cong. Rec. 7213 (1964).\nMany other legislators made statements to a similar effect; we see no need to set out each remark in full here. The central point is this: while an employer may not take gender into account in making an employment decision (except in those very narrow circumstances in which gender is a BFOQ), it is free to decide against a woman for other reasons. We think these principles require that, once a plaintiff in a Title VII case shows that gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability 10 only by proving that it would have made the same [490 U.S. 228, 245]   decision even if it had not allowed gender to play such a role. This balance of burdens is the direct result of Title VII's balance of rights.\nOur holding casts no shadow on Burdine, in which we decided that, even after a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, the burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that its stated legitimate reason for the employment decision was the true reason.450 U.S., at 256 -258. We stress, first, that neither [490 U.S. 228, 246]   court below shifted the burden of persuasion to Price Waterhouse on this question, and in fact, the District Court found that Hopkins had not shown that the firm's stated reason for its decision was pretextual. 618 F. Supp., at 1114-1115. Moreover, since we hold that the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion on the issue whether gender played a part in the employment decision, the situation before us is not the one of ""shifting burdens"" that we addressed in Burdine. Instead, the employer's burden is most appropriately deemed an affirmative defense: the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another. See NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. 393, 400 (1983). 11  \nPrice Waterhouse's claim that the employer does not bear any burden of proof (if it bears one at all) until the plaintiff has shown ""substantial evidence that Price Waterhouse's explanation for failing to promote Hopkins was not the `true reason' for its action"" (Brief for Petitioner 20) merely restates its argument that the plaintiff in a mixed-motives case [490 U.S. 228, 247]   must squeeze her proof into Burdine's framework. Where a decision was the product of a mixture of legitimate and illegitimate motives, however, it simply makes no sense to ask whether the legitimate reason was ""the `true reason'"" (Brief for Petitioner 20 (emphasis added)) for the decision - which is the question asked by Burdine. See Transportation Management, supra, at 400, n. 5. 12 Oblivious to this last point, the dissent would insist that Burdine's framework perform work that it was never intended to perform. It would require a plaintiff who challenges an adverse employment decision in which both legitimate and illegitimate considerations played a part to pretend that the decision, in fact, stemmed from a single source - for the premise of Burdine is that either a legitimate or an illegitimate set of considerations led to the challenged decision. To say that Burdine's evidentiary scheme will not help us decide a case admittedly involving both kinds of considerations is not to cast aspersions on the utility of that scheme in the circumstances for which it was designed. [490 U.S. 228, 248]  \nB\nIn deciding as we do today, we do not traverse new ground. We have in the past confronted Title VII cases in which an employer has used an illegitimate criterion to distinguish among employees, and have held that it is the employer's burden to justify decisions resulting from that practice. When an employer has asserted that gender is a BFOQ within the meaning of 703(e), for example, we have assumed that it is the employer who must show why it must use gender as a criterion in employment. See Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 332 -337 (1977). In a related context, although the Equal Pay Act expressly permits employers to pay different wages to women where disparate pay is the result of a ""factor other than sex,"" see 29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1), we have decided that it is the employer, not the employee, who must prove that the actual disparity is not sex linked. See Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 196 (1974). Finally, some courts have held that, under Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, it is the employer who has the burden of showing that its limitations on the work that it allows a pregnant woman to perform are necessary in light of her pregnancy. See, e. g., Hayes v. Shelby Memorial Hospital, 726 F.2d 1543, 1548 (CA11 1984); Wright v. Olin Corp., 697 F.2d 1172, 1187 (CA4 1982). As these examples demonstrate, our assumption always has been that if an employer allows gender to affect its decision-making process, then it must carry the burden of justifying its ultimate decision. We have not in the past required women whose gender has proved relevant to an employment decision to establish the negative proposition that they would not have been subject to that decision had they been men, and we do not do so today.\nWe have reached a similar conclusion in other contexts where the law announces that a certain characteristic is irrelevant to the allocation of burdens and benefits. In Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), the [490 U.S. 228, 249]   plaintiff claimed that he had been discharged as a public school teacher for exercising his free-speech rights under the First Amendment. Because we did not wish to ""place an employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing,"" id., at 285, we concluded that such an employee ""ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record."" Id., at 286. We therefore held that once the plaintiff had shown that his constitutionally protected speech was a ""substantial"" or ""motivating factor"" in the adverse treatment of him by his employer, the employer was obligated to prove ""by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to [the plaintiff] even in the absence of the protected conduct."" Id., at 287. A court that finds for a plaintiff under this standard has effectively concluded that an illegitimate motive was a ""but-for"" cause of the employment decision. See Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School Dist., 439 U.S. 410, 417 (1979). See also Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 270 -271, n. 21 (1977) (applying Mt. Healthy standard where plaintiff alleged that unconstitutional motive had contributed to enactment of legislation); Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 228 (1985) (same).\nIn Transportation Management, we upheld the NLRB's interpretation of 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, which forbids a court to order affirmative relief for discriminatory conduct against a union member ""if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause."" 29 U.S.C. 160(c). The Board had decided that this provision meant that once an employee had shown that his suspension or discharge was based in part on hostility to unions, it was up to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision in the absence of this impermissible motive. In such a situation, we emphasized, [490 U.S. 228, 250]   ""[t]he employer is a wrongdoer; he has acted out of a motive that is declared illegitimate by the statute. It is fair that he bear the risk that the influence of legal and illegal motives cannot be separated, because he knowingly created the risk and because the risk was created not by innocent activity but by his own wrongdoing.""462 U.S., at 403 .\nWe have, in short, been here before. Each time, we have concluded that the plaintiff who shows that an impermissible motive played a motivating part in an adverse employment decision has thereby placed upon the defendant the burden to show that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the unlawful motive. Our decision today treads this well-worn path.\nC\nIn saying that gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, we mean that, if we asked the employer at the moment of the decision what its reasons were and if we received a truthful response, one of those reasons would be that the applicant or employee was a woman. 13 In the specific context of sex stereotyping, an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender.\nAlthough the parties do not overtly dispute this last proposition, the placement by Price Waterhouse of ""sex stereotyping"" in quotation marks throughout its brief seems to us an insinuation either that such stereotyping was not present in this case or that it lacks legal relevance. We reject both possibilities.[490 U.S. 228, 251]   As to the existence of sex stereotyping in this case, we are not inclined to quarrel with the District Court's conclusion that a number of the partners' comments showed sex stereotyping at work. See infra, at 255-256. As for the legal relevance of sex stereotyping, we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group, for ""`[i]n forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex, Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.'"" Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 707 , n. 13 (1978), quoting Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194, 1198 (CA7 1971). An employer who objects to aggressiveness in women but whose positions require this trait places women in an intolerable and impermissible catch 22: out of a job if they behave aggressively and out of a job if they do not. Title VII lifts women out of this bind.\nRemarks at work that are based on sex stereotypes do not inevitably prove that gender played a part in a particular employment decision. The plaintiff must show that the employer actually relied on her gender in making its decision. In making this showing, stereotyped remarks can certainly be evidence that gender played a part. In any event, the stereotyping in this case did not simply consist of stray remarks. On the contrary, Hopkins proved that Price Waterhouse invited partners to submit comments; that some of the comments stemmed from sex stereotypes; that an important part of the Policy Board's decision on Hopkins was an assessment of the submitted comments; and that Price Waterhouse in no way disclaimed reliance on the sex-linked evaluations. This is not, as Price Waterhouse suggests, ""discrimination in the air""; rather, it is, as Hopkins puts it, ""discrimination brought to ground and visited upon"" an employee. Brief for Respondent 30. By focusing on Hopkins' specific proof, however, we do not suggest a limitation on the possible ways [490 U.S. 228, 252]   of proving that stereotyping played a motivating role in an employment decision, and we refrain from deciding here which specific facts, ""standing alone,"" would or would not establish a plaintiff's case, since such a decision is unnecessary in this case. But see post, at 277 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment).\nAs to the employer's proof, in most cases, the employer should be able to present some objective evidence as to its probable decision in the absence of an impermissible motive. 14 Moreover, proving ""`that the same decision would have been justified . . . is not the same as proving that the same decision would have been made.'"" Givhan, 439 U.S., at 416 , quoting Ayers v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 555 F.2d 1309, 1315 (CA5 1977). An employer may not, in other words, prevail in a mixed-motives case by offering a legitimate and sufficient reason for its decision if that reason did not motivate it at the time of the decision. Finally, an employer may not meet its burden in such a case by merely showing that at the time of the decision it was motivated only in part by a legitimate reason. The very premise of a mixed-motives case is that a legitimate reason was present, and indeed, in this case, Price Waterhouse already has made this showing by convincing Judge Gesell that Hopkins' interpersonal problems were a legitimate concern. The employer instead must show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced it to make the same decision.\nIII\nThe courts below held that an employer who has allowed a discriminatory impulse to play a motivating part in an employment decision must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have made the same decision in the absence [490 U.S. 228, 253]   of discrimination. We are persuaded that the better rule is that the employer must make this showing by a preponderance of the evidence.\nConventional rules of civil litigation generally apply in Title VII cases, see, e. g., United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983) (discrimination not to be ""treat[ed] . . . differently from other ultimate questions of fact""), and one of these rules is that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e. g., Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375, 390 (1983). Exceptions to this standard are uncommon, and in fact are ordinarily recognized only when the government seeks to take unusual coercive action - action more dramatic than entering an award of money damages or other conventional relief - against an individual. See Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 756 (1982) (termination of parental rights); Addington v. Texas,441 U.S. 418, 427 (1979) (involuntary commitment); Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276 (1966) (deportation); Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 122 , 125 (1943) (denaturalization). Only rarely have we required clear and convincing proof where the action defended against seeks only conventional relief, see, e. g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 342 (1974) (defamation), and we find it significant that in such cases it was the defendant rather than the plaintiff who sought the elevated standard of proof - suggesting that this standard ordinarily serves as a shield rather than, as Hopkins seeks to use it, as a sword.\nIt is true, as Hopkins emphasizes, that we have noted the ""clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that petitioner had sustained some damage and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount."" Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562 (1931). Likewise, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation does require federal agencies proved to have violated [490 U.S. 228, 254]   Title VII to show by clear and convincing evidence that an individual employee is not entitled to relief. See 29 CFR 1613.271(c)(2) (1988). And finally, it is true that we have emphasized the importance of make-whole relief for victims of discrimination. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975). Yet each of these sources deals with the proper determination of relief rather than with the initial finding of liability. This is seen most easily in the EEOC's regulation, which operates only after an agency or the EEOC has found that ""an employee of the agency was discriminated against."" See 29 CFR 1613.271(c) (1988). Because we have held that, by proving that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination, the employer may avoid a finding of liability altogether and not simply avoid certain equitable relief, these authorities do not help Hopkins to show why we should elevate the standard of proof for an employer in this position.\nSignificantly, the cases from this Court that most resemble this one, Mt. Healthy and Transportation Management, did not require clear and convincing proof. Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S., at 287 ; Transportation Management, 462 U.S., at 400 , 403. We are not inclined to say that the public policy against firing employees because they spoke out on issues of public concern or because they affiliated with a union is less important than the policy against discharging employees on the basis of their gender. Each of these policies is vitally important, and each is adequately served by requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\nAlthough Price Waterhouse does not concretely tell us how its proof was preponderant even if it was not clear and convincing, this general claim is implicit in its request for the less stringent standard. Since the lower courts required Price Waterhouse to make its proof by clear and convincing evidence, they did not determine whether Price Waterhouse had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have placed Hopkins' candidacy on hold even if it had not permitted [490 U.S. 228, 255]   sex-linked evaluations to play a part in the decision-making process. Thus, we shall remand this case so that that determination can be made.\nIV\nThe District Court found that sex stereotyping ""was permitted to play a part"" in the evaluation of Hopkins as a candidate for partnership. 618 F. Supp., at 1120. Price Waterhouse disputes both that stereotyping occurred and that it played any part in the decision to place Hopkins' candidacy on hold. In the firm's view, in other words, the District Court's factual conclusions are clearly erroneous. We do not agree.\nIn finding that some of the partners' comments reflected sex stereotyping, the District Court relied in part on Dr. Fiske's expert testimony. Without directly impugning Dr. Fiske's credentials or qualifications, Price Waterhouse insinuates that a social psychologist is unable to identify sex stereotyping in evaluations without investigating whether those evaluations have a basis in reality. This argument comes too late. At trial, counsel for Price Waterhouse twice assured the court that he did not question Dr. Fiske's expertise (App. 25) and failed to challenge the legitimacy of her discipline. Without contradiction from Price Waterhouse, Fiske testified that she discerned sex stereotyping in the partners' evaluations of Hopkins, and she further explained that it was part of her business to identify stereotyping in written documents. Id., at 64. We are not inclined to accept petitioner's belated and unsubstantiated characterization of Dr. Fiske's testimony as ""gossamer evidence"" (Brief for Petitioner 20) based only on ""intuitive hunches"" (id., at 44) and of her detection of sex stereotyping as ""intuitively divined"" (id., at 43). Nor are we disposed to adopt the dissent's dismissive attitude toward Dr. Fiske's field of study and toward her own professional integrity, see post, at 293-294, n. 5. [490 U.S. 228, 256] \nIndeed, we are tempted to say that Dr. Fiske's expert testimony was merely icing on Hopkins' cake. It takes no special training to discern sex stereotyping in a description of an aggressive female employee as requiring ""a course at charm school."" Nor, turning to Thomas Beyer's memorable advice to Hopkins, does it require expertise in psychology to know that, if an employee's flawed ""interpersonal skills"" can be corrected by a soft-hued suit or a new shade of lipstick, perhaps it is the employee's sex and not her interpersonal skills that has drawn the criticism. 15  \nPrice Waterhouse also charges that Hopkins produced no evidence that sex stereotyping played a role in the decision to place her candidacy on hold. As we have stressed, however, Hopkins showed that the partnership solicited evaluations from all of the firm's partners; that it generally relied very heavily on such evaluations in making its decision; that some of the partners' comments were the product of stereotyping; and that the firm in no way disclaimed reliance on those particular comments, either in Hopkins' case or in the past. Certainly a plausible - and, one might say, inevitable - conclusion to draw from this set of circumstances is that the Policy Board in making its decision did in fact take into account all of the partners' comments, including the comments that were motivated by stereotypical notions about women's proper deportment. 16   [490 U.S. 228, 257]  \nPrice Waterhouse concedes that the proof in Transportation Management adequately showed that the employer there had relied on an impermissible motivation in firing the plaintiff. Brief for Petitioner 45. But the only evidence in that case that a discriminatory motive contributed to the plaintiff's discharge was that the employer harbored a grudge toward the plaintiff on account of his union activity; there was, contrary to Price Waterhouse's suggestion, no direct evidence that that grudge had played a role in the decision, and, in fact, the employer had given other reasons in explaining the plaintiff's discharge. See 462 U.S., at 396 . If the partnership considers that proof sufficient, we do not know why it takes such vehement issue with Hopkins' proof.\nNor is the finding that sex stereotyping played a part in the Policy Board's decision undermined by the fact that many of the suspect comments were made by supporters rather than detractors of Hopkins. A negative comment, even when made in the context of a generally favorable review, nevertheless may influence the decisionmaker to think less highly of the candidate; the Policy Board, in fact, did not simply tally the ""yesses"" and ""noes"" regarding a candidate, but carefully reviewed the content of the submitted comments. The additional suggestion that the comments were made by ""persons outside the decisionmaking chain"" (Brief for Petitioner 48) - and therefore could not have harmed Hopkins - simply ignores the critical role that partners' comments played in the Policy Board's partnership decisions.\nPrice Waterhouse appears to think that we cannot affirm the factual findings of the trial court without deciding that, instead of being overbearing and aggressive and curt, Hopkins is, in fact, kind and considerate and patient. If this is indeed its impression, petitioner misunderstands the theory [490 U.S. 228, 258]   on which Hopkins prevailed. The District Judge acknowledged that Hopkins' conduct justified complaints about her behavior as a senior manager. But he also concluded that the reactions of at least some of the partners were reactions to her as a woman manager. Where an evaluation is based on a subjective assessment of a person's strengths and weaknesses, it is simply not true that each evaluator will focus on, or even mention, the same weaknesses. Thus, even if we knew that Hopkins had ""personality problems,"" this would not tell us that the partners who cast their evaluations of Hopkins in sex-based terms would have criticized her as sharply (or criticized her at all) if she had been a man. It is not our job to review the evidence and decide that the negative reactions to Hopkins were based on reality; our perception of Hopkins' character is irrelevant. We sit not to determine whether Ms. Hopkins is nice, but to decide whether the partners reacted negatively to her personality because she is a woman.\nV\nWe hold that when a plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that her gender played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff's gender into account. Because the courts below erred by deciding that the defendant must make this proof by clear and convincing evidence, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse on liability and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.\nIt is so ordered.\nFootnotes\n[ Footnote 1 ] Before the time for reconsideration came, two of the partners in Hopkins' office withdrew their support for her, and the office informed her that she would not be reconsidered for partnership. Hopkins then resigned. Price Waterhouse does not challenge the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the refusal to repropose her for partnership amounted to a constructive discharge. That court remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings to determine appropriate relief, and those proceedings have been stayed pending our decision. Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 3. We are concerned today only with Price Waterhouse's decision to place Hopkins' candidacy on hold. Decisions pertaining to advancement to partnership are, of course, subject to challenge under Title VII. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 (1984).\n[ Footnote 2 ] This question has, to say the least, left the Circuits in disarray. The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits require a plaintiff challenging an adverse employment decision to show that, but for her gender (or race or religion or national origin), the decision would have been in her favor. See, e. g., Bellissimo v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 764 F.2d 175, 179 (CA3 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1035 (1986); Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., 759 F.2d 355, 365-366 (CA4 1985); Peters v. Shreveport, 818 F.2d 1148, 1161 (CA5 1987); McQuillen v. Wisconsin Education Assn. Council, 830 F.2d 659, 664-665 (CA7 1987). The First, Second, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, on the other hand, hold that once the plaintiff has shown that a discriminatory motive was a ""substantial"" or ""motivating"" factor in an employment decision, the employer may avoid a finding of liability only by proving that it would have made the same decision even in the absence of discrimination. These courts have either specified that the employer must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence or have not mentioned the proper standard of proof. See, e. g., Fields v. Clark University, 817 F.2d 931, 936-937 (CA1 1987) (""motivating factor""); Berl v. Westchester County, 849 F.2d 712, 714-715 (CA2 1988) (""substantial part""); Terbovitz v. Fiscal Court of Adair County, Ky., 825 F.2d 111, 115 (CA6 1987) (""motivating factor""); Bell v. Birmingham Linen Service, 715 F.2d 1552, 1557 (CA11 1983). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as shown in this case, follows the same rule except that it requires that the employer's proof be clear and convincing rather than merely preponderant. 263 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 333-334, 825 F.2d 458, 470-471 (1987); see also Toney v. Block, 227 U.S. App. D.C. 273, 275, 705 F.2d 1364, 1366 (1983) (Scalia, J.) (it would be ""destructive of the purposes of [Title VII] to require the plaintiff to establish . . . the difficult hypothetical proposition that, had there been no discrimination, the employment decision would have been made in his favor""). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also requires clear and convincing proof, but it goes further by holding that a Title VII violation is made out as soon as the plaintiff shows that an impermissible motivation played a part in an employment [490 U.S. 228, 239]   decision - at which point the employer may avoid reinstatement and an award of backpay by proving that it would have made the same decision in the absence of the unlawful motive. See, e. g. Fadhl v. City and County of San Francisco, 741 F.2d 1163, 1165-1166 (1984) (Kennedy, J.) (""significant factor""). Last, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit draws the same distinction as the Ninth between the liability and remedial phases of Title VII litigation, but requires only a preponderance of the evidence from the employer. See, e. g., Bibbs v. Block, 778 F.2d 1318, 1320-1324 (1985) (en banc) (""discernible factor"").\n[ Footnote 3 ] We disregard, for purposes of this discussion, the special context of affirmative action.\n[ Footnote 4 ] Congress specifically declined to require that an employment decision have been ""for cause"" in order to escape an affirmative penalty (such as reinstatement or backpay) from a court. As introduced in the House, the bill that became Title VII forbade such affirmative relief if an ""individual was . . . refused employment or advancement, or was suspended or discharged for cause."" H. R. Rep. No. 7152, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 77 (1963) (emphasis added). The phrase ""for cause"" eventually was deleted in favor of the phrase ""for any reason other than"" one of the enumerated characteristics. See 110 Cong. Rec. 2567-2571 (1964). Representative Celler explained that this substitution ""specif[ied] cause""; in his view, a court ""cannot find any violation of the act which is based on facts other . . . than discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, or national origin."" Id., at 2567.\n[ Footnote 5 ] In this Court, Hopkins for the first time argues that Price Waterhouse violated 703(a)(2) when it subjected her to a biased decisionmaking process that ""tended to deprive"" a woman of partnership on the basis of her sex. Since Hopkins did not make this argument below, we do not address it.\n[ Footnote 6 ] We made passing reference to a similar question in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 282 , n. 10 (1976), where we stated that when a Title VII plaintiff seeks to show that an employer's explanation for a challenged employment decision is pretextual, ""no more is required to be shown than that race was a `but for' cause."" This passage, however, does not suggest that the plaintiff must show but-for cause; it indicates only that if she does so, she prevails. More important, McDonald dealt with the question whether the employer's stated reason for its decision was the reason for its action; unlike the case before us today, therefore, McDonald did not involve mixed motives. This difference is decisive in distinguishing this case from those involving ""pretext."" See infra, at 247, n. 12.\n[ Footnote 7 ] Congress specifically rejected an amendment that would have placed the word ""solely"" in front of the words ""because of."" 110 Cong. Rec. 2728, 13837 (1964).\n[ Footnote 8 ] We have in the past acknowledged the authoritativeness of this interpretive memorandum, written by the two bipartisan ""captains"" of Title VII. See, e. g., Firefighters v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 581 , n. 14 (1984).\n[ Footnote 9 ] Many of the legislators' statements, such as the memorandum quoted in text, focused specifically on race rather than on gender or religion or national origin. We do not, however, limit their statements to the context of [490 U.S. 228, 244]   race, but instead we take them as general statements on the meaning of Title VII. The somewhat bizarre path by which ""sex"" came to be included as a forbidden criterion for employment - it was included in an attempt to defeat the bill, see C. & B. Whalen, The Longest Debate: A Legislative History of the 1964 Civil Rights Act 115-117 (1985) - does not persuade us that the legislators' statements pertaining to race are irrelevant to cases alleging gender discrimination. The amendment that added ""sex"" as one of the forbidden criteria for employment was passed, of course, and the statute on its face treats each of the enumerated categories exactly the same. By the same token, our specific references to gender throughout this opinion, and the principles we announce, apply with equal force to discrimination based on race, religion, or national origin.\n[ Footnote 10 ] Hopkins argues that once she made this showing, she was entitled to a finding that Price Waterhouse had discriminated against her on the basis of sex; as a consequence, she says, the partnership's proof could only limit the relief she received. She relies on Title VII's 706(g), which permits a court to award affirmative relief when it finds that an employer ""has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice,"" and yet forbids a court to order reinstatement of, or backpay to, ""an individual . . . if such individual was refused . . . employment or advancement [490 U.S. 228, 245]   or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g) (emphasis added). We do not take this provision to mean that a court inevitably can find a violation of the statute without having considered whether the employment decision would have been the same absent the impermissible motive. That would be to interpret 706(g) - a provision defining remedies - to influence the substantive commands of the statute. We think that this provision merely limits courts' authority to award affirmative relief in those circumstances in which a violation of the statute is not dependent upon the effect of the employer's discriminatory practices on a particular employee, as in pattern-or-practice suits and class actions. ""The crucial difference between an individual's claim of discrimination and a class action alleging a general pattern or practice of discrimination is manifest. The inquiry regarding an individual's claim is the reason for a particular employment decision, while `at the liability stage of a pattern-or-practice trial the focus often will not be on individual hiring decisions, but on a pattern of discriminatory decisionmaking.'"" Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 876 (1984), quoting Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 360 , n. 46 (1977). Without explicitly mentioning this portion of 706(g), we have in the past held that Title VII does not authorize affirmative relief for individuals as to whom, the employer shows, the existence of systemic discrimination had no effect. See Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 772(1976); Teamsters v. United States, supra, at 367-371; East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 404 , n. 9 (1977). These decisions suggest that the proper focus of 706(g) is on claims of systemic discrimination, not on charges of individual discrimination. Cf. NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. 393 (1983) (upholding the National Labor Relations Board's identical interpretation of 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 160(c), which contains language almost identical to 706(g)).\n[ Footnote 11 ] Given that both the plaintiff and defendant bear a burden of proof in cases such as this one, it is surprising that the dissent insists that our approach requires the employer to bear ""the ultimate burden of proof."" Post, at 288. It is, moreover, perfectly consistent to say both that gender was a factor in a particular decision when it was made and that, when the situation is viewed hypothetically and after the fact, the same decision would have been made even in the absence of discrimination. Thus, we do not see the ""internal inconsistency"" in our opinion that the dissent perceives. See post, at 285-286. Finally, where liability is imposed because an employer is unable to prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not discriminated, this is not an imposition of liability ""where sex made no difference to the outcome."" Post, at 285. In our adversary system, where a party has the burden of proving a particular assertion and where that party is unable to meet its burden, we assume that that assertion is inaccurate. Thus, where an employer is unable to prove its claim that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination, we are entitled to conclude that gender did make a difference to the outcome.\n[ Footnote 12 ] Nothing in this opinion should be taken to suggest that a case must be correctly labeled as either a ""pretext"" case or a ""mixed-motives"" case from the beginning in the District Court; indeed, we expect that plaintiffs often will allege, in the alternative, that their cases are both. Discovery often will be necessary before the plaintiff can know whether both legitimate and illegitimate considerations played a part in the decision against her. At some point in the proceedings, of course, the District Court must decide whether a particular case involves mixed motives. If the plaintiff fails to satisfy the factfinder that it is more likely than not that a forbidden characteristic played a part in the employment decision, then she may prevail only if she proves, following Burdine, that the employer's stated reason for its decision is pretextual. The dissent need not worry that this evidentiary scheme, if used during a jury trial, will be so impossibly confused and complex as it imagines. See, e. g., post, at 292. Juries long have decided cases in which defendants raised affirmative defenses. The dissent fails, moreover, to explain why the evidentiary scheme that we endorsed over 10 years ago in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), has not proved unworkable in that context but would be hopelessly complicated in a case brought under federal antidiscrimination statutes.\n[ Footnote 13 ] After comparing this description of the plaintiff's proof to that offered by JUSTICE O'CONNOR's opinion concurring in the judgment, post, at 276-277, we do not understand why the concurrence suggests that they are meaningfully different from each other, see post, at 275, 277-279. Nor do we see how the inquiry that we have described is ""hypothetical,"" see post, at 283, n. 1. It seeks to determine the content of the entire set of reasons for a decision, rather than shaving off one reason in an attempt to determine what the decision would have been in the absence of that consideration. The inquiry that we describe thus strikes us as a distinctly non-hypothetical one.\n[ Footnote 14 ] JUSTICE WHITE's suggestion, post, at 261, that the employer's own testimony as to the probable decision in the absence of discrimination is due special credence where the court has, contrary to the employer's testimony, found that an illegitimate factor played a part in the decision, is baffling.\n[ Footnote 15 ] We reject the claim, advanced by Price Waterhouse here and by the dissenting judge below, that the District Court clearly erred in finding that Beyer was ""responsible for telling [Hopkins] what problems the Policy Board had identified with her candidacy."" 618 F. Supp., at 1117. This conclusion was reasonable in light of the testimony at trial of a member of both the Policy Board and the Admissions Committee, who stated that he had ""no doubt"" that Beyer would discuss with Hopkins the reasons for placing her candidacy on hold and that Beyer ""knew exactly where the problems were"" regarding Hopkins. Tr. 316.\n[ Footnote 16 ] We do not understand the dissenters' dissatisfaction with the District Judge's statements regarding the failure of Price Waterhouse to ""sensitize"" partners to the dangers of sexism. Post, at 294. Made in the context [490 U.S. 228, 257]   of determining that Price Waterhouse had not disclaimed reliance on sex-based evaluations, and following the judge's description of the firm's history of condoning such evaluations, the judge's remarks seem to us justified.\nJUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.\nIn my view, to determine the proper approach to causation in this case, we need look only to the Court's opinion in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977). In Mt. Healthy, a public employee was not rehired, in part [490 U.S. 228, 259]   because of his exercise of First Amendment rights and in part because of permissible considerations. The Court rejected a rule of causation that focused ""solely on whether protected conduct played a part, `substantial' or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire,"" on the grounds that such a rule could make the employee better off by exercising his constitutional rights than by doing nothing at all. Id., at 285. Instead, the Court outlined the following approach:\n""Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that his conduct was a `substantial factor' - or, to put it in other words, that it was a `motivating factor' in the Board's decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct."" Id., at 287 (footnote omitted).\nIt is not necessary to get into semantic discussions on whether the Mt. Healthy approach is ""but-for"" causation in another guise or creates an affirmative defense on the part of the employer to see its clear application to the issues before us in this case. As in Mt. Healthy, the District Court found that the employer was motivated by both legitimate and illegitimate factors. And here, as in Mt. Healthy, and as the Court now holds, Hopkins was not required to prove that the illegitimate factor was the only, principal, or true reason for petitioner's action. Rather, as JUSTICE O'CONNOR states, her burden was to show that the unlawful motive was a substantial factor in the adverse employment action. The District Court, as its opinion was construed by the Court of Appeals, so found, 263 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 333, 334, 825 F.2d 458, 470, 471 (1987), and I agree that the finding was supported by the record. The burden of persuasion then [490 U.S. 228, 260]   should have shifted to Price Waterhouse to prove ""by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision . . . in the absence of"" the unlawful motive. Mt. Healthy, supra, at 287.\nI agree with JUSTICE BRENNAN that applying this approach to causation in Title VII cases is not a departure from, and does not require modification of, the Court's holdings in Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), and McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). The Court has made clear that ""mixed-motives"" cases, such as the present one, are different from pretext cases such as McDonnell Douglas and Burdine. In pretext cases, ""the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but not both, were the `true' motives behind the decision."" NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. 393, 400 , n. 5 (1983). In mixed-motives cases, however, there is no one ""true"" motive behind the decision. Instead, the decision is a result of multiple factors, at least one of which is legitimate. It can hardly be said that our decision in this case is a departure from cases that are ""inapposite."" Ibid. I also disagree with the dissent's assertion that this approach to causation is inconsistent with our statement in Burdine that ""[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff."" 450 U.S., at 253 . As we indicated in Transportation Management Corp., the showing required by Mt. Healthy does not improperly shift from the plaintiff the ultimate burden of persuasion on whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against him or her. See 462 U.S., at 400 , n. 5.\nBecause the Court of Appeals required Price Waterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reached the same employment decision in the absence of the improper motive, rather than merely requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence as in Mt. Healthy, I concur in the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding. [490 U.S. 228, 261]   With respect to the employer's burden, however, the plurality seems to require, at least in most cases, that the employer submit objective evidence that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. Ante, at 252. In my view, however, there is no special requirement that the employer carry its burden by objective evidence. In a mixed-motives case, where the legitimate motive found would have been ample grounds for the action taken, and the employer credibly testifies that the action would have been taken for the legitimate reasons alone, this should be ample proof. This would even more plainly be the case where the employer denies any illegitimate motive in the first place but the court finds that illegitimate, as well as legitimate, factors motivated the adverse action. *  \n[ Footnote * ] I agree with the plurality that if the employer carries this burden, there has been no violation of Title VII.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring in the judgment.\nI agree with the plurality that, on the facts presented in this case, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision concerning Ann Hopkins' candidacy absent consideration of her gender. I further agree that this burden shift is properly part of the liability phase of the litigation. I thus concur in the judgment of the Court. My disagreement stems from the plurality's conclusions concerning the substantive requirement of causation under the statute and its broad statements regarding the applicability of the allocation of the burden of proof applied in this case. The evidentiary rule the Court adopts today should be viewed as a supplement to the careful framework established by our unanimous decisions in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), for use in cases such as this one where the employer has created uncertainty as to causation by knowingly giving [490 U.S. 228, 262]   substantial weight to an impermissible criterion. I write separately to explain why I believe such a departure from the McDonnell Douglas standard is justified in the circumstances presented by this and like cases, and to express my views as to when and how the strong medicine of requiring the employer to bear the burden of persuasion on the issue of causation should be administered.\nI\nTitle VII provides in pertinent part: ""It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a) (emphasis added). The legislative history of Title VII bears out what its plain language suggests: a substantive violation of the statute only occurs when consideration of an illegitimate criterion is the ""but-for"" cause of an adverse employment action. The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was attempting to eradicate discriminatory actions in the employment setting, not mere discriminatory thoughts. Critics of the bill that became Title VII labeled it a ""thought control bill,"" and argued that it created a ""punishable crime that does not require an illegal external act as a basis for judgment."" 100 Cong. Rec. 7254 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Ervin). Senator Case, whose views the plurality finds so persuasive elsewhere, responded:\n""The man must do or fail to do something in regard to employment. There must be some specific external act, more than a mental act. Only if he does the act because of the grounds stated in the bill would there be any legal consequences."" Ibid.\nThus, I disagree with the plurality's dictum that the words ""because of"" do not mean ""but-for"" causation; manifestly they [490 U.S. 228, 263]   do. See Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 499 (1986) (WHITE, J., dissenting) (""[T]he general policy under Title VII is to limit relief for racial discrimination in employment practices to actual victims of the discrimination""). We should not, and need not, deviate from that policy today. The question for decision in this case is what allocation of the burden of persuasion on the issue of causation best conforms with the intent of Congress and the purposes behind Title VII.\nThe evidence of congressional intent as to which party should bear the burden of proof on the issue of causation is considerably less clear. No doubt, as a general matter, Congress assumed that the plaintiff in a Title VII action would bear the burden of proof on the elements critical to his or her case. As the dissent points out, post, at 287, n. 3, the interpretative memorandum submitted by sponsors of Title VII indicates that ""the plaintiff, as in any civil case, would have the burden of proving that discrimination had occurred."" 110 Cong. Rec. 7214 (1964) (emphasis added). But in the area of tort liability, from whence the dissent's ""but-for"" standard of causation is derived, see post, at 282, the law has long recognized that in certain ""civil cases"" leaving the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff to prove ""but-for"" causation would be both unfair and destructive of the deterrent purposes embodied in the concept of duty of care. Thus, in multiple causation cases, where a breach of duty has been established, the common law of torts has long shifted the burden of proof to multiple defendants to prove that their negligent actions were not the ""but-for"" cause of the plaintiff's injury. See e. g., Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 84-87, 199 P.2d 1, 3-4 (1948). The same rule has been applied where the effect of a defendant's tortious conduct combines with a force of unknown or innocent origin to produce the harm to the plaintiff. See Kingston v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 191 Wis. 610, 616, 211 N. W. 913, 915 (1927) (""Granting that the union of that fire [caused by defendant's [490 U.S. 228, 264]  negligence] with another of natural origin, or with another of much greater proportions, is available as a defense, the burden is on the defendant to show that . . . the fire set by him was not the proximate cause of the damage""). See also 2 J. Wigmore, Select Cases on the Law of Torts 153, p. 865 (1912) (""When two or more persons by their acts are possibly the sole cause of a harm, or when two or more acts of the same person are possibly the sole cause, and the plaintiff has introduced evidence that one of the two persons, or one of the same person's two acts, is culpable, then the defendant has the burden of proving that the other person, or his other act, was the sole cause of the harm"").\nWhile requiring that the plaintiff in a tort suit or a Title VII action prove that the defendant's ""breach of duty"" was the ""but-for"" cause of an injury does not generally hamper effective enforcement of the policies behind those causes of action,\n""at other times the [but-for] test demands the impossible. It challenges the imagination of the trier to probe into a purely fanciful and unknowable state of affairs. He is invited to make an estimate concerning facts that concededly never existed. The very uncertainty as to what might have happened opens the door wide for conjecture. But when conjecture is demanded it can be given a direction that is consistent with the policy considerations that underlie the controversy."" Malone, Ruminations on Cause-In-Fact, 9 Stan. L. Rev. 60, 67 (1956).\nLike the common law of torts, the statutory employment ""tort"" created by Title VII has two basic purposes. The first is to deter conduct which has been identified as contrary to public policy and harmful to society as a whole. As we have noted in the past, the award of backpay to a Title VII plaintiff provides ""the spur or catalyst which causes employers and unions to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as [490 U.S. 228, 265]   possible, the last vestiges"" of discrimination in employment. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417 -418 (1975) (citation omitted). The second goal of Title VII is ""to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination."" Id., at 418.\nBoth these goals are reflected in the elements of a disparate treatment action. There is no doubt that Congress considered reliance on gender or race in making employment decisions an evil in itself. As Senator Clark put it, ""[t]he bill simply eliminates consideration of color [or other forbidden criteria] from the decision to hire or promote."" 110 Cong. Rec. 7218 (1964). See also id., at 13088 (remarks of Sen. Humphrey) (""What the bill does . . . is simply to make it an illegal practice to use race as a factor in denying employment""). Reliance on such factors is exactly what the threat of Title VII liability was meant to deter. While the main concern of the statute was with employment opportunity, Congress was certainly not blind to the stigmatic harm which comes from being evaluated by a process which treats one as an inferior by reason of one's race or sex. This Court's decisions under the Equal Protection Clause have long recognized that whatever the final outcome of a decisional process, the inclusion of race or sex as a consideration within it harms both society and the individual. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989). At the same time, Congress clearly conditioned legal liability on a determination that the consideration of an illegitimate factor caused a tangible employment injury of some kind.\nWhere an individual disparate treatment plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in an adverse employment decision, the deterrent purpose of the statute has clearly been triggered. More importantly, as an evidentiary matter, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that absent further explanation, the employer's discriminatory motivation ""caused"" the employment decision. The employer has [490 U.S. 228, 266]   not yet been shown to be a violator, but neither is it entitled to the same presumption of good faith concerning its employment decisions which is accorded employers facing only circumstantial evidence of discrimination. Both the policies behind the statute, and the evidentiary principles developed in the analogous area of causation in the law of torts, suggest that at this point the employer may be required to convince the factfinder that, despite the smoke, there is no fire.\nWe have given recognition to these principles in our cases which have discussed the ""remedial phase"" of class action disparate treatment cases. Once the class has established that discrimination against a protected group was essentially the employer's ""standard practice,"" there has been harm to the group and injunctive relief is appropriate. But as to the individual members of the class, the liability phase of the litigation is not complete. See Dillon v. Coles, 746 F.2d 998, 1004 (CA3 1984) (""It is misleading to speak of the additional proof required by an individual class member for relief as being a part of the damage phase, that evidence is actually an element of the liability portion of the case"") (footnote omitted). Because the class has already demonstrated that, as a rule, illegitimate factors were considered in the employer's decisions, the burden shifts to the employer ""to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for legitimate reasons."" Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 362 (1977). See also Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 772 (1976).\nThe individual members of a class action disparate treatment case stand in much the same position as Ann Hopkins here. There has been a strong showing that the employer has done exactly what Title VII forbids, but the connection between the employer's illegitimate motivation and any injury to the individual plaintiff is unclear. At this point calling upon the employer to show that despite consideration of illegitimate factors the individual plaintiff would not have been hired or promoted in any event hardly seems ""unfair"" or [490 U.S. 228, 267]   contrary to the substantive command of the statute. In fact, an individual plaintiff who has shown that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in the decision in his or her case has proved more than the class member in a Teamsters type action. The latter receives the benefit of a burden shift to the defendant based on the likelihood that an illegitimate criterion was a factor in the individual employment decision.\nThere is a tension between the Franks and Teamsters line of decisions and the individual disparate treatment cases cited by the dissent. See post, at 286-289. Logically, under the dissent's view, each member of a disparate treatment class action would have to show ""but-for"" causation as to his or her individual employment decision, since it is not an element of the pattern or practice proof of the entire class and it is statutorily mandated that the plaintiff bear the burden of proof on this issue throughout the litigation. While the Court has properly drawn a distinction between the elements of a class action claim and an individual disparate treatment claim, see Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,467 U.S. 867, 873 -878 (1984), and I do not suggest the wholesale transposition of rules from one setting to the other, our decisions in Teamsters and Franks do indicate a recognition that presumptions shifting the burden of persuasion based on evidentiary probabilities and the policies behind the statute are not alien to our Title VII jurisprudence.\nMoreover, placing the burden on the defendant in this case to prove that the same decision would have been justified by legitimate reasons is consistent with our interpretation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Like a disparate treatment plaintiff, one who asserts that governmental action violates the Equal Protection Clause must show that he or she is ""the victim of intentional discrimination."" Burdine, 450 U.S., at 256 . Compare post, at 286, 289 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), with Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976). In Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625 (1972), we dealt with a criminal defendant's allegation that [490 U.S. 228, 268]   members of his race had been invidiously excluded from the grand jury which indicted him in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In addition to the statistical evidence presented by petitioner in that case, we noted that the State's ""selection procedures themselves were not racially neutral."" Id., at 630. Once the consideration of race in the decisional process had been established, we held that ""the burden of proof shifts to the State to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result."" Id., at 632.\nWe adhered to similar principles in Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), a case which, like this one, presented the problems of motivation and causation in the context of a multimember decisionmaking body authorized to consider a wide range of factors in arriving at its decisions. In Arlington Heights a group of minority plaintiffs claimed that a municipal governing body's refusal to rezone a plot of land to allow for the construction of low-income integrated housing was racially motivated. On the issue of causation, we indicated that the plaintiff was not required\n""to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes. Rarely can it be said that a legislature or administrative body operating under a broad mandate made a decision motivated solely by a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the `dominant' or `primary' one. In fact, it is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous competing considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbitrariness or irrationality. But racial discrimination is not just another competing consideration. When there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, [490 U.S. 228, 269]   this judicial deference is no longer justified."" Id., at 265-266 (citation omitted).\nIf the strong presumption of regularity and rationality of legislative decisionmaking must give way in the face of evidence that race has played a significant part in a legislative decision, I simply cannot believe that Congress intended Title VII to accord more deference to a private employer in the face of evidence that its decisional process has been substantially infected by discrimination. Indeed, where a public employee brings a ""disparate treatment"" claim under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause the employee is entitled to the favorable evidentiary framework of Arlington Heights. See, e. g., Hervey v. Little Rock, 787 F.2d 1223, 1233-1234 (CA8 1986) (applying Arlington Heights to public employee's claim of sex discrimination in promotion decision); Lee v. Russell County Bd. of Education, 684 F.2d 769, 773-774 (CA11 1982) (applying Arlington Heights to public employees' claims of race discrimination in discharge case). Under the dissent's reading of Title VII, Congress' extension of the coverage of the statute to public employers in 1972 has placed these employees under a less favorable evidentiary regime. In my view, nothing in the language, history, or purpose of Title VII prohibits adoption of an evidentiary rule which places the burden of persuasion on the defendant to demonstrate that legitimate concerns would have justified an adverse employment action where the plaintiff has convinced the factfinder that a forbidden factor played a substantial role in the employment decision. Even the dissenting judge below ""[had] no quarrel with [the] principle"" that ""a party with one permissible motive and one unlawful one may prevail only by affirmatively proving that it would have acted as it did even if the forbidden motive were absent."" 263 U.S. App. D.C. 321, 341, 825 F.2d 458, 478 (1987) (Williams, J. dissenting). [490 U.S. 228, 270]  \nII\nThe dissent's summary of our individual disparate treatment cases to date is fair and accurate, and amply demonstrates that the rule we adopt today is at least a change in direction from some of our prior precedents. See post, at 286-289. We have indeed emphasized in the past that in an individual disparate treatment action the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion throughout the litigation. Nor have we confined the word ""pretext"" to the narrow definition which the plurality attempts to pin on it today. See ante, at 244-247. McDonnell Douglas and Burdine clearly contemplated that a disparate treatment plaintiff could show that the employer's proffered explanation for an event was not ""the true reason"" either because it never motivated the employer in its employment decisions or because it did not do so in a particular case. McDonnell Douglas and Burdine assumed that the plaintiff would bear the burden of persuasion as to both these attacks, and we clearly depart from that framework today. Such a departure requires justification, and its outlines should be carefully drawn.\nFirst, McDonnell Douglas itself dealt with a situation where the plaintiff presented no direct evidence that the employer had relied on a forbidden factor under Title VII in making an employment decision. The prima facie case established there was not difficult to prove, and was based only on the statistical probability that when a number of potential causes for an employment decision are eliminated an inference arises that an illegitimate factor was in fact the motivation behind the decision. See Teamsters, 431 U.S., at 358 , n. 44 (""[T]he McDonnell Douglas formula does not require direct proof of discrimination""). In the face of this inferential proof, the employer's burden was deemed to be only one of production; the employer must articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action. See Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978). The plaintiff must then be given an ""opportunity to demonstrate [490 U.S. 228, 271]   by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision."" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S., at 805 . Our decision in Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248(1981), also involved the ""narrow question"" whether, after a plaintiff had carried the ""not onerous"" burden of establishing the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas, the burden of persuasion should be shifted to the employer to prove that a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action existed. 450 U.S., at 250 . As the discussion of Teamsters and Arlington Heights indicates, I do not think that the employer is entitled to the same presumption of good faith where there is direct evidence that it has placed substantial reliance on factors whose consideration is forbidden by Title VII.\nThe only individual disparate treatment case cited by the dissent which involved the kind of direct evidence of discriminatory animus with which we are confronted here is United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 713 -714, n. 2 (1983). The question presented to the Court in that case involved only a challenge to the elements of the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, see Pet. for Cert. in United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, O. T. 1981, No. 81-1044, and the question we confront today was neither briefed nor argued to the Court. As should be apparent, the entire purpose of the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case is to compensate for the fact that direct evidence of intentional discrimination is hard to come by. That the employer's burden in rebutting such an inferential case of discrimination is only one of production does not mean that the scales should be weighted in the same manner where there is direct evidence of intentional discrimination. Indeed, in one Age Discrimination in Employment Act case, the Court seemed to indicate that ""the McDonnell Douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination."" Trans World [490 U.S. 228, 272]   Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985). See also East Texas Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 -404, n. 9 (1977).\nSecond, the facts of this case, and a growing number like it decided by the Courts of Appeals, convince me that the evidentiary standard I propose is necessary to make real the promise of McDonnell Douglas that ""[i]n the implementation of [employment] decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no . . . discrimination, subtle or otherwise."" 411 U.S., at 801 . In this case, the District Court found that a number of the evaluations of Ann Hopkins submitted by partners in the firm overtly referred to her failure to conform to certain gender stereotypes as a factor militating against her election to the partnership. 618 F. Supp. 1109, 1116-1117 (DC 1985). The District Court further found that these evaluations were given ""great weight"" by the decisionmakers at Price Waterhouse. Id., at 1118. In addition, the District Court found that the partner responsible for informing Hopkins of the factors which caused her candidacy to be placed on hold, indicated that her ""professional"" problems would be solved if she would ""walk more femininely, talk more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."" Id., at 1117 (footnote omitted). As the Court of Appeals characterized it, Ann Hopkins proved that Price Waterhouse ""permitt[ed] stereotypical attitudes towards women to play a significant, though unquantifiable, role in its decision not to invite her to become a partner."" 263 U.S. App. D.C., at 324, 825 F.2d, at 461.\nAt this point Ann Hopkins had taken her proof as far as it could go. She had proved discriminatory input into the decisional process, and had proved that participants in the process considered her failure to conform to the stereotypes credited by a number of the decisionmakers had been a substantial factor in the decision. It is as if Ann Hopkins were sitting in the hall outside the room where partnership decisions were being made. As the partners filed in to consider [490 U.S. 228, 273]   her candidacy, she heard several of them make sexist remarks in discussing her suitability for partnership. As the decisionmakers exited the room, she was told by one of those privy to the decisionmaking process that her gender was a major reason for the rejection of her partnership bid. If, as we noted in Teamsters, ""[p]resumptions shifting the burden of proof are often created to reflect judicial evaluations of probabilities and to conform with a party's superior access to the proof,"" 431 U.S., at 359 , n. 45, one would be hard pressed to think of a situation where it would be more appropriate to require the defendant to show that its decision would have been justified by wholly legitimate concerns.\nMoreover, there is mounting evidence in the decisions of the lower courts that respondent here is not alone in her inability to pinpoint discrimination as the precise cause of her injury, despite having shown that it played a significant role in the decisional process. Many of these courts, which deal with the evidentiary issues in Title VII cases on a regular basis, have concluded that placing the risk of nonpersuasion on the defendant in a situation where uncertainty as to causation has been created by its consideration of an illegitimate criterion makes sense as a rule of evidence and furthers the substantive command of Title VII. See, e. g., Bell v. Birmingham Linen Service, 715 F.2d 1552, 1556 (CA11 1983) (Tjoflat, J.) (""It would be illogical, indeed ironic, to hold a Title VII plaintiff presenting direct evidence of a defendant's intent to discriminate to a more stringent burden of proof, or to allow a defendant to meet that direct proof by merely articulating, but not proving, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its action""). Particularly in the context of the professional world, where decisions are often made by collegial bodies on the basis of largely subjective criteria, requiring the plaintiff to prove that any one factor was the definitive cause of the decisionmakers' action may be tantamount to declaring Title VII inapplicable to such decisions. See, e. g., Fields v. Clark University, 817 F.2d 931, 935-937 [490 U.S. 228, 274]   (CA1 1987) (where plaintiff produced ""strong evidence"" that sexist attitudes infected faculty tenure decision, burden properly shifted to defendant to show that it would have reached the same decision absent discrimination); Thompkins v. Morris Brown College, 752 F.2d 558, 563 (CA11 1985) (direct evidence of discriminatory animus in decision to discharge college professor shifted burden of persuasion to defendant).\nFinally, I am convinced that a rule shifting the burden to the defendant where the plaintiff has shown that an illegitimate criterion was a ""substantial factor"" in the employment decision will not conflict with other congressional policies embodied in Title VII. Title VII expressly provides that an employer need not give preferential treatment to employees or applicants of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in order to maintain a work force in balance with the general population. See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(j). The interpretive memorandum, whose authoritative force is noted by the plurality, see ante, at 243, n. 8, specifically provides: ""There is no requirement in title VII that an employer maintain a racial balance in his work force. On the contrary, any deliberate attempt to maintain a racial balance, whatever such a balance may be, would involve a violation of title VII because maintaining such a balance would require an employer to hire or refuse to hire on the basis of race."" 110 Cong. Rec. 7213 (1964).\nLast Term, in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 (1988), the Court unanimously concluded that the disparate impact analysis first enunciated in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424(1971), should be extended to subjective or discretionary selection processes. At the same time a plurality of the Court indicated concern that the focus on bare statistics in the disparate impact setting could force employers to adopt ""inappropriate prophylactic measures"" in violation of 2000e-2(j). The plurality went on to emphasize that in a disparate impact case, the plaintiff may not simply [490 U.S. 228, 275]   point to a statistical disparity in the employer's work force. Instead, the plaintiff must identify a particular employment practice and ""must offer statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their membership in a protected group."" 487 U.S., at 994 . The plurality indicated that ""the ultimate burden of proving that discrimination against a protected group has been caused by a specific employment practice remains with the plaintiff at all times."" Id., at 997.\nI believe there are significant differences between shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer in a case resting purely on statistical proof as in the disparate impact setting and shifting the burden of persuasion in a case like this one, where an employee has demonstrated by direct evidence that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in a particular employment decision. First, the explicit consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in making employment decisions ""was the most obvious evil Congress had in mind when it enacted Title VII."" Teamsters, 431 U.S., at 335 , n. 15. While the prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas and the statistical showing of imbalance involved in a disparate impact case may both be indicators of discrimination or its ""functional equivalent,"" they are not, in and of themselves, the evils Congress sought to eradicate from the employment setting. Second, shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer in a situation like this one creates no incentive to preferential treatment in violation of 2000e-(2)(j). To avoid bearing the burden of justifying its decision, the employer need not seek racial or sexual balance in its work force; rather, all it need do is avoid substantial reliance on forbidden criteria in making its employment decisions.\nWhile the danger of forcing employers to engage in unwarranted preferential treatment is thus less dramatic in this setting than in the situation the Court faced in Watson, it is far from wholly illusory. Based on its misreading of [490 U.S. 228, 276]   the words ""because of"" in the statute, see ante, at 240-242, the plurality appears to conclude that if a decisional process is ""tainted"" by awareness of sex or race in any way, the employer has violated the statute, and Title VII thus commands that the burden shift to the employer to justify its decision. Ante, at 250-252. The plurality thus effectively reads the causation requirement out of the statute, and then replaces it with an ""affirmative defense."" Ante, at 244-247.\nIn my view, in order to justify shifting the burden on the issue of causation to the defendant, a disparate treatment plaintiff must show by direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the decision. As the Court of Appeals noted below: ""While most circuits have not confronted the question squarely, the consensus among those that have is that once a Title VII plaintiff has demonstrated by direct evidence that discriminatory animus played a significant or substantial role in the employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the decision would have been the same absent discrimination."" 263 U.S. App. D.C., at 333-344, 825 F.2d, at 470-471. Requiring that the plaintiff demonstrate that an illegitimate factor played a substantial role in the employment decision identifies those employment situations where the deterrent purpose of Title VII is most clearly implicated. As an evidentiary matter, where a plaintiff has made this type of strong showing of illicit motivation, the factfinder is entitled to presume that the employer's discriminatory animus made a difference to the outcome, absent proof to the contrary from the employer. Where a disparate treatment plaintiff has made such a showing, the burden then rests with the employer to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor. The employer need not isolate the sole cause for the decision; rather it must demonstrate that with the illegitimate factor removed from the calculus, sufficient business reasons would have induced it to take the same employment [490 U.S. 228, 277]  action. This evidentiary scheme essentially requires the employer to place the employee in the same position he or she would have occupied absent discrimination. Cf. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,429 U.S. 274, 286 (1977). If the employer fails to carry this burden, the factfinder is justified in concluding that the decision was made ""because of"" consideration of the illegitimate factor and the substantive standard for liability under the statute is satisfied.\nThus, stray remarks in the workplace, while perhaps probative of sexual harassment, see Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 63 -69 (1986), cannot justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria. Nor can statements by nondecisionmakers, or statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself, suffice to satisfy the plaintiff's burden in this regard. In addition, in my view testimony such as Dr. Fiske's in this case, standing alone, would not justify shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer. Race and gender always ""play a role"" in an employment decision in the benign sense that these are human characteristics of which decisionmakers are aware and about which they may comment in a perfectly neutral and nondiscriminatory fashion. For example, in the context of this case, a mere reference to ""a lady candidate"" might show that gender ""played a role"" in the decision, but by no means could support a rational factfinder's inference that the decision was made ""because of"" sex. What is required is what Ann Hopkins showed here: direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.\nIt should be obvious that the threshold standard I would adopt for shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant differs substantially from that proposed by the plurality, the plurality's suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding. See ante, at 250, n. 13. The plurality proceeds from the premise that the words ""because of"" in the statute do not embody any [490 U.S. 228, 278]   causal requirement at all. Under my approach, the plaintiff must produce evidence sufficient to show that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the particular employment decision such that a reasonable factfinder could draw an inference that the decision was made ""because of"" the plaintiff's protected status. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the defendant to prove that the decision would have been justified by other, wholly legitimate considerations. See also ante, at 259-260 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment).\nIn sum, because of the concerns outlined above, and because I believe that the deterrent purpose of Title VII is disserved by a rule which places the burden of proof on plaintiffs on the issue of causation in all circumstances, I would retain but supplement the framework we established in McDonnell Douglas and subsequent cases. The structure of the presentation of evidence in an individual disparate treatment case should conform to the general outlines we established in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine. First, the plaintiff must establish the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case by showing membership in a protected group, qualification for the job, rejection for the position, and that after rejection the employer continued to seek applicants of complainant's general qualifications. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S., at 802 . The plaintiff should also present any direct evidence of discriminatory animus in the decisional process. The defendant should then present its case, including its evidence as to legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment decision. As the dissent notes, under this framework, the employer ""has every incentive to convince the trier of fact that the decision was lawful."" Post, at 292, citing Burdine, 450 U.S., at 258 . Once all the evidence has been received, the court should determine whether the McDonnell Douglas or Price Waterhouse framework properly applies to the evidence before it. If the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Price Waterhouse threshold, the case should be decided under the principles enunciated in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, [490 U.S. 228, 279]   with the plaintiff bearing the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue whether the employment action was taken because of discrimination. In my view, such a system is both fair and workable, and it calibrates the evidentiary requirements demanded of the parties to the goals behind the statute itself.\nI agree with the dissent, see post, at 293, n. 4, that the evidentiary framework I propose should be available to all disparate treatment plaintiffs where an illegitimate consideration played a substantial role in an adverse employment decision. The Court's allocation of the burden of proof in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 626 -627 (1987), rested squarely on ""the analytical framework set forth in McDonnell Douglas,"" id., at 626, which we alter today. It would be odd to say the least if the evidentiary rules applicable to Title VII actions were themselves dependent on the gender or the skin color of the litigants. But see ante, at 239, n. 3.\nIn this case, I agree with the plurality that petitioner should be called upon to show that the outcome would have been the same if respondent's professional merit had been its only concern. On remand, the District Court should determine whether Price Waterhouse has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that if gender had not been part of the process, its employment decision concerning Ann Hopkins would nonetheless have been the same.\n",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6501,,LawOpinionsResearch,OpinionSCOTUS,LongText,2,,,"<center><b>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</b>\nMcDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP. v. GREEN \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT \n</center>\n\nNo. 72-490. \n\nArgued March 28, 1973 \nDecided May 14, 1973 \n\nRespondent, a black civil rights activist, engaged in disruptive and illegal activity against petitioner as part of his protest that his discharge as an employee of petitioner's and the firm's general hiring practices were racially motivated. When petitioner, who subsequently advertised for qualified personnel, rejected respondent's re-employment application on the ground of the illegal conduct, respondent filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC found that there was reasonable cause to believe that petitioner's rejection of respondent violated 704 (a) of the Act, which forbids discrimination against applicants or employees for attempting to protest or correct allegedly discriminatory employment conditions, but made no finding on respondent's allegation that petitioner had also violated 703 (a) (1), which prohibits discrimination in any employment decision. Following unsuccessful EEOC conciliation efforts, respondent brought suit in the District Court, which ruled that respondent's illegal activity was not protected by 704 (a) and dismissed the 703 (a) (1) claim because the EEOC had made no finding with respect thereto. The Court of Appeals affirmed the 704 (a) ruling, but reversed with respect to 703 (a) (1), holding that an EEOC determination of reasonable cause was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to claiming a violation of that provision in federal court. Held:\n\n1. A complaint's right to bring suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not confined to charges as to which the EEOC has made a reasonable-cause finding, and the District Court's error in holding to the contrary was not harmless since the issues raised with respect to 703 (a) (1) were not identical to those with respect to 704 (a) and the dismissal of the former charge may have prejudiced respondent's efforts at trial. Pp. 798-800.\n2. In a private, non-class-action complaint under Title VII charging racial employment discrimination, the complaint has the burden of establishing a prima facie case, which he can satisfy by showing that (i) he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) he [411 U.S. 792, 793]   applied and was qualified for a job the employer was trying to fill; (iii) though qualified, he was rejected; and (iv) thereafter the employer continued to seek applicants with complainant's qualifications. P. 802.\n3. Here, the Court of Appeals, though correctly holding that respondent proved a prima facie case, erred in holding that petitioner had not discharged its burden of proof in rebuttal by showing that its stated reason for the rehiring refusal was based on respondent's illegal activity. But on remand respondent must be afforded a fair opportunity of proving that petitioner's stated reason was just a pretext for a racially discriminatory decision, such as by showing that whites engaging in similar illegal activity were retained or hired by petitioner. Other evidence that may be relevant, depending on the circumstances, could include facts that petitioner had discriminated against respondent when he was an employee or followed a discriminatory policy toward minority employees. Pp. 802-805.\n463 F.2d 337, vacated and remanded.\nPOWELL, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\nVeryl L. Riddle argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were R. H. McRoberts and Thomas C. Walsh.\n\nLouis Gilden argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Jack Greenberg, James M. Nabrit III, William L. Robinson, and Albert Rosenthal. *  \n\n[ Footnote * ] Milton A. Smith and Lawrence M. Cohen filed a brief for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States as amicus curiae urging reversal.\n\nSolicitor General Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Pottinger, Deputy Solicitor General Wallace, Keith A. Jones, David L. Rose, Julia P. Cooper, and Beatrice Rosenberg filed a brief for the United States as amicus curiae urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe case before us raises significant questions as to the proper order and nature of proof in actions under Title [411 U.S. 792, 794]   VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.\n\nPetitioner, McDonnell Douglas Corp., is an aerospace and aircraft manufacturer headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, where it employs over 30,000 people. Respondent, a black citizen of St. Louis, worked for petitioner as a mechanic and laboratory technician from 1956 until August 28, 1964 1 when he was laid off in the course of a general reduction in petitioner's work force.\n\nRespondent, a long-time activist in the civil rights movement, protested vigorously that his discharge and the general hiring practices of petitioner were racially motivated. 2 As part of this protest, respondent and other members of the Congress on Racial Equality illegally stalled their cars on the main roads leading to petitioner's plant for the purpose of blocking access to it at the time of the morning shift change. The District Judge described the plan for, and respondent's participation in, the ""stall-in"" as follows:\n\n""[F]ive teams, each consisting of four cars would `tie up' five main access roads into McDonnell at the time of the morning rush hour. The drivers of the cars were instructed to line up next to each other completely blocking the intersections or roads. The drivers were also instructed to stop their cars, turn off the engines, pull the emergency brake, raise all windows, lock the doors, and remain in their cars until the police arrived. The plan was to have the cars remain in position for one hour. [411 U.S. 792, 795]  \n""Acting under the `stall in' plan, plaintiff [respondent in the present action] drove his car onto Brown Road, a McDonnell access road, at approximately 7:00 a. m., at the start of the morning rush hour. Plaintiff was aware of the traffic problems that would result. He stopped his car with the intent to block traffic. The police arrived shortly and requested plaintiff to move his car. He refused to move his car voluntarily. Plaintiff's car was towed away by the police, and he was arrested for obstructing traffic. Plaintiff pleaded guilty to the charge of obstructing traffic and was fined."" 318 F. Supp. 846, 849.\nOn July 2, 1965, a ""lock-in"" took place wherein a chain and padlock were placed on the front door of a building to prevent the occupants, certain of petitioner's employees, from leaving. Though respondent apparently knew beforehand of the ""lock-in"" the full extent of his involvement remains uncertain. 3   [411 U.S. 792, 796]  \nSome three weeks following the ""lock-in,"" on July 25, 1965, petitioner publicly advertised for qualified mechanics, respondent's trade, and respondent promptly applied for re-employment. Petitioner turned down respondent, basing its rejection on respondent's participation in the ""stall-in"" and ""lock-in."" Shortly thereafter, respondent filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that petitioner had refused to rehire him because of his race and persistent involvement in the civil rights movement, in violation of 703 (a) (1) and 704 (a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2 (a) (1) and 2000e-3 (a). 4 The former section generally prohibits racial discrimination in any employment decision while the latter forbids discrimination against applicants or employees for attempting to protest or correct allegedly discriminatory conditions of employment. [411 U.S. 792, 797]  \n\nThe Commission made no finding on respondent's allegation of racial bias under 703 (a) (1), but it did find reasonable cause to believe petitioner had violated 704 (a) by refusing to rehire respondent because of his civil rights activity. After the Commission unsuccessfully attempted to conciliate the dispute, it advised respondent in March 1968, of his right to institute a civil action in federal court within 30 days.\n\nOn April 15, 1968, respondent brought the present action, claiming initially a violation of 704 (a) and, in an amended complaint, a violation of 703 (a) (1) as well. 5 The District Court dismissed the latter claim of racial discrimination in petitioner's hiring procedures on the ground that the Commission had failed to make a determination of reasonable cause to believe that a violation of that section had been committed. The District Court also found that petitioner's refusal to rehire respondent was based solely on his participation in the illegal demonstrations and not on his legitimate civil rights activities. The court concluded that nothing in Title VII or 704 protected ""such activity as employed by the plaintiff in the `stall in' and `lock in' demonstrations."" 318 F. Supp., at 850.\n\nOn appeal, the Eighth Circuit affirmed that unlawful protests were not protected activities under 704 (a), 6 but reversed the dismissal of respondent's 703 (a) (1) claim relating to racially discriminatory hiring practices, holding that a prior Commission determination of reasonable cause was not a jurisdictional prerequisite to raising a claim under that section in federal court. The court [411 U.S. 792, 798]   ordered the case remanded for trial of respondent's claim under 703 (a) (1).\n\nIn remanding, the Court of Appeals attempted to set forth standards to govern the consideration of respondent's claim. The majority noted that respondent had established a prima facie case of racial discrimination; that petitioner's refusal to rehire respondent rested on ""subjective"" criteria which carried little weight in rebutting charges of discrimination; that, though respondent's participation in the unlawful demonstrations might indicate a lack of a responsible attitude toward performing work for that employer, respondent should be given the opportunity to demonstrate that petitioner's reasons for refusing to rehire him were mere pretext. 7 In order to clarify the standards governing the disposition of an action challenging employment discrimination, we granted certiorari, 409 U.S. 1036 (1972).\n\nI\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that absence of a Commission finding of reasonable cause cannot bar suit under an appropriate section of Title VII and that the District Judge erred in dismissing respondent's claim of racial discrimination under 703 (a) (1). Respondent satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites to a federal action (i) by filing timely charges of employment discrimination with the Commission and (ii) by receiving and acting upon the Commission's statutory notice of the right to sue, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5 (a) and 2000e-5 (e). The Act does not restrict a complainant's right to sue to those charges as to which the Commission has made findings of reasonable cause, and we will not engraft on the statute a requirement which may inhibit the review of [411 U.S. 792, 799]   claims of employment discrimination in the federal courts. The Commission itself does not consider the absence of a ""reasonable cause"" determination as providing employer immunity from similar charges in a federal court, 29 CFR 1601.30, and the courts of appeal have held that, in view of the large volume of complaints before the Commission and the nonadversary character of many of its proceedings, ""court actions under Title VII are de novo proceedings and . . . a Commission `no reasonable cause' finding does not bar a lawsuit in the case."" Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., 444 F.2d 791, 800 (CA4 1971); Beverly v. Lone Star Lead Construction Corp., 437 F.2d 1136 (CA5 1971); Flowers v. Local 6, Laborers International Union of North America, 431 F.2d 205 (CA7 1970); Fekete v. U.S. Steel Corp., 424 F.2d 331 (CA3 1970).\n\nPetitioner argues, as it did below, that respondent sustained no prejudice from the trial court's erroneous ruling because in fact the issue of racial discrimination in the refusal to re-employ ""was tried thoroughly"" in a trial lasting four days with ""at least 80%"" of the questions relating to the issue of ""race."" 8 Petitioner, therefore, requests that the judgment below be vacated and the cause remanded with instructions that the judgment of the District Court be affirmed. 9 We cannot agree that the dismissal of respondent's 703 (a) (1) claim was harmless error. It is not clear that the District Court's findings as to respondent's 704 (a) contentions involved the identical issues raised by his claim under 703 (a) (1). The former section relates solely to discrimination against an applicant or employee on account of his participation in legitimate civil rights activities or protests, while the latter section deals with the broader and centrally [411 U.S. 792, 800]   important question under the Act of whether, for any reason, a racially discriminatory employment decision has been made. Moreover, respondent should have been accorded the right to prepare his case and plan the strategy of trial with the knowledge that the 703 (a) (1) cause of action was properly before the District Court. 10 Accordingly, we remand the case for trial of respondent's claim of racial discrimination consistent with the views set forth below.\n\nII\nThe critical issue before us concerns the order and allocation of proof in a private, non-class action challenging employment discrimination. The language of Title VII makes plain the purpose of Congress to assure equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate those discriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially stratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority citizens. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429 (1971); Castro v. Beecher, 459 F.2d 725 (CA1 1972); Chance v. Board of Examiners, 458 F.2d 1167 (CA2 1972); Quarles v. Philip Morris, Inc., 279 F. Supp. 505 (ED Va. 1968). As noted in Griggs, supra:\n\n""Congress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guarantee a job to every person regardless of qualifications. In short, the Act does not command that any person be hired simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, or because he is a member of a minority group. Discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what Congress has proscribed. [411 U.S. 792, 801]   What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification."" Id., at 430-431.\nThere are societal as well as personal interests on both sides of this equation. The broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer, is efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and racially neutral employment and personnel decisions. In the implementation of such decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no racial discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\nIn this case respondent, the complainant below, charges that he was denied employment ""because of his involvement in civil rights activities"" and ""because of his race and color."" 11 Petitioner denied discrimination of any kind, asserting that its failure to re-employ respondent was based upon and justified by his participation in the unlawful conduct against it. Thus, the issue at the trial on remand is framed by those opposing factual contentions. The two opinions of the Court of Appeals and the several opinions of the three judges of that court attempted, with a notable lack of harmony, to state the applicable rules as to burden of proof and how this shifts upon the making of a prima facie case. 12 We now address this problem. [411 U.S. 792, 802]  \n\nThe complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination. This may be done by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications. 13 In the instant case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that respondent proved a prima facie case. 463 F.2d 337, 353. Petitioner sought mechanics, respondent's trade, and continued to do so after respondent's rejection. Petitioner moreover, does not dispute respondent's qualifications 14 and acknowledges that his past work performance in petitioner's employ was ""satisfactory."" 15  \n\nThe burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection. We need not attempt in the instant case to detail every matter which fairly could be [411 U.S. 792, 803]   recognized as a reasonable basis for a refusal to hire. Here petitioner has assigned respondent's participation in unlawful conduct against it as the cause for his rejection. We think that this suffices to discharge petitioner's burden of proof at this stage and to meet respondent's prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nThe Court of Appeals intimated, however, that petitioner's stated reason for refusing to rehire respondent was a ""subjective"" rather than objective criterion which ""carr[ies] little weight in rebutting charges of discrimination,"" 463 F.2d, at 352. This was among the statements which caused the dissenting judge to read the opinion as taking ""the position that such unlawful acts as Green committed against McDonnell would not legally entitle McDonnell to refuse to hire him, even though no racial motivation was involved . . . ."" Id., at 355. Regardless of whether this was the intended import of the opinion, we think the court below seriously underestimated the rebuttal weight to which petitioner's reasons were entitled. Respondent admittedly had taken part in a carefully planned ""stall-in,"" designed to tie up access to and egress from petitioner's plant at a peak traffic hour. 16 Nothing in Title VII compels an employer to absolve and rehire one who has engaged in such deliberate, unlawful activity against it. 17 In upholding, under the National Labor Relations Act, the discharge of employees who had seized and forcibly retained [411 U.S. 792, 804]   an employer's factory buildings in an illegal sit-down strike, the Court noted pertinently:\n\n""We are unable to conclude that Congress intended to compel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct, - to invest those who go on strike with an immunity from discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the employer's property . . . . Apart from the question of the constitutional validity of an enactment of that sort, it is enough to say that such a legislative intention should be found in some definite and unmistakable expression."" NLRB v. Fansteel Corp., 306 U.S. 240, 255 (1939).\nPetitioner's reason for rejection thus suffices to meet the prima facie case, but the inquiry must not end here. While Title VII does not, without more, compel rehiring of respondent, neither does it permit petitioner to use respondent's conduct as a pretext for the sort of discrimination prohibited by 703 (a) (1). On remand, respondent must, as the Court of Appeals recognized, be afforded a fair opportunity to show that petitioner's stated reason for respondent's rejection was in fact pretext. Especially relevant to such a showing would be evidence that white employees involved in acts against petitioner of comparable seriousness to the ""stall-in"" were nevertheless retained or rehired. Petitioner may justifiably refuse to rehire one who was engaged in unlawful, disruptive acts against it, but only if this criterion is applied alike to members of all races.\nOther evidence that may be relevant to any showing of pretext includes facts as to the petitioner's treatment of respondent during his prior term of employment; petitioner's reaction, if any, to respondent's legitimate civil rights activities; and petitioner's general policy and [411 U.S. 792, 805]   practice with respect to minority employment. 18 On the latter point, statistics as to petitioner's employment policy and practice may be helpful to a determination of whether petitioner's refusal to rehire respondent in this case conformed to a general pattern of discrimination against blacks. Jones v. Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc., 431 F.2d 245 (CA10 1970); Blumrosen, Strangers in Paradise: Griggs v. Duke Power Co., and the Concept of Employment Discrimination, 71 Mich. L. Rev. 59, 91-94 (1972). 19 In short, on the retrial respondent must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.\n\nThe court below appeared to rely upon Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, in which the Court stated: ""If an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot [411 U.S. 792, 806]   be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited."" 401 U.S., at 431 . 20 But Griggs differs from the instant case in important respects. It dealt with standardized testing devices which, however neutral on their face, operated to exclude many blacks who were capable of performing effectively in the desired positions. Griggs was rightly concerned that childhood deficiencies in the education and background of minority citizens, resulting from forces beyond their control, not be allowed to work a cumulative and invidious burden on such citizens for the remainder of their lives. Id., at 430. Respondent, however, appears in different clothing. He had engaged in a seriously disruptive act against the very one from whom he now seeks employment. And petitioner does not seek his exclusion on the basis of a testing device which overstates what is necessary for competent performance, or through some sweeping disqualification of all those with any past record of unlawful behavior, however remote, insubstantial, or unrelated to applicant's personal qualifications as an employee. Petitioner assertedly rejected respondent for unlawful conduct against it and, in the absence of proof of pretext or discriminatory application of such a reason, this cannot be thought the kind of ""artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment"" which the Court found to be the intention of Congress to remove. Id., at 431. 21   [411 U.S. 792, 807]  \n\nIII\nIn sum, respondent should have been allowed to pursue his claim under 703 (a) (1). If the evidence on retrial is substantially in accord with that before us in this case, we think that respondent carried his burden of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination and that petitioner successfully rebutted that case. But this does not end the matter. On retrial, respondent must be afforded a fair opportunity to demonstrate that petitioner's assigned reason for refusing to re-employ was a pretext or discriminatory in its application. If the District Judge so finds, he must order a prompt and appropriate remedy. In the absence of such a finding, petitioner's refusal to rehire must stand.\n\nThe judgment is vacated and the cause is hereby remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nSo ordered.\nFootnotes\n[ Footnote 1 ] His employment during these years was continuous except for 21 months of service in the military.\n[ Footnote 2 ] The Court of Appeals noted that respondent then ""filed formal complaints of discrimination with the President's Commission on Civil Rights, the Justice Department, the Department of the Navy, the Defense Department, and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights."" 463 F.2d 337, 339 (1972).\n\n[ Footnote 3 ] The ""lock-in"" occurred during a picketing demonstration by ACTION, a civil rights organization, at the entrance to a downtown office building which housed a part of petitioner's offices and in which certain of petitioner's employees were working at the time. A chain and padlock were placed on the front door of the building to prevent ingress and egress. Although respondent acknowledges that he was chairman of ACTION at the time, that the demonstration was planned and staged by his group, that he participated in and indeed was in charge of the picket line in front of the building, that he was told in advance by a member of ACTION ""that he was planning to chain the front door,"" and that he ""approved of"" chaining the door, there is no evidence that respondent personally took part in the actual ""lock-in,"" and he was not arrested. App. 132-133.\n\nThe Court of Appeals majority, however, found that the record did ""not support the trial court's conclusion that Green `actively cooperated' in chaining the doors of the downtown St. Louis building during the `lock-in' demonstration."" 463 F.2d, at 341. See also concurring opinion of Judge Lay. Id., at 345. Judge Johnsen, in [411 U.S. 792, 796]   dissent, agreed with the District Court that the ""chaining and padlocking [were] carried out as planned, [and that] Green had in fact given it . . . approval and authorization."" Id., at 348.\n\nIn view of respondent's admitted participation in the unlawful ""stall-in,"" we find it unnecessary to resolve the contradictory contentions surrounding this ""lock-in.""\n\n[ Footnote 4 ] Section 703 (a) (1) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2 (a) (1), in pertinent part provides:\n\n""It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .""\nSection 704 (a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-3 (a), in pertinent part provides:\n""It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter . . . .""\n[ Footnote 5 ] Respondent also contested the legality of his 1964 discharge by petitioner, but both courts held this claim barred by the statute of limitations. Respondent does not challenge those rulings here.\n\n[ Footnote 6 ] Respondent has not sought review of this issue.\n\n[ Footnote 7 ] All references here are to Part V of the revised opinion of the Court of Appeals, 463 F.2d, at 352, which superseded Part V of the court's initial opinion with respect to the order and nature of proof.\n\n[ Footnote 8 ] Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.\n\n[ Footnote 9 ] Brief for Petitioner 40.\n\n[ Footnote 10 ] The trial court did not discuss respondent's 703 (a) (1) claim in its opinion and denied requests for discovery of statistical materials which may have been relevant to that claim.\n\n[ Footnote 11 ] The respondent initially charged petitioner in his complaint filed April 15, 1968, with discrimination because of his ""involvement in civil rights activities."" App. 8. In his amended complaint, filed March 20, 1969, plaintiff broadened his charge to include denial of employment because of race in violation of 703 (a) (1). App. 27.\n\n[ Footnote 12 ] See original opinion of the majority of the panel which heard the case, 463 F.2d, at 338; the concurring opinion of Judge Lay, id., at 344; the first opinion of Judge Johnsen, dissenting in part, id., at 346; [411 U.S. 792, 802]   the revised opinion of the majority, id., at 352; and the supplemental dissent of Judge Johnsen, id., at 353. A petition for rehearing en banc was denied by an evenly divided Court of Appeals.\n\n[ Footnote 13 ] The facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification above of the prima facie proof required from respondent is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.\n\n[ Footnote 14 ] We note that the issue of what may properly be used to test qualifications for employment is not present in this case. Where employers have instituted employment tests and qualifications with an exclusionary effect on minority applicants, such requirements must be ""shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs"" for which they were used, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971). Castro v. Beecher, 459 F.2d 725 (CA1 1972); Chance v. Board of Examiners, 458 F.2d 1167 (CA2 1972).\n\n[ Footnote 15 ] Tr. of Oral Arg. 3: 463 F.2d, at 353.\n\n[ Footnote 16 ] The trial judge noted that no personal injury or property damage resulted from the ""stall-in"" due ""solely to the fact that law enforcement officials had obtained notice in advance of plaintiff's [here respondent's] demonstration and were at the scene to remove plaintiff's car from the highway."" 318 F. Supp. 846, 851.\n\n[ Footnote 17 ] The unlawful activity in this case was directed specifically against petitioner. We need not consider or decide here whether, or under what circumstances, unlawful activity not directed against the particular employer may be a legitimate justification for refusing to hire.\n\n[ Footnote 18 ] We are aware that some of the above factors were, indeed, considered by the District Judge in finding under 704 (a), that ""defendant's [here petitioner's] reasons for refusing to rehire the plaintiff were motivated solely and simply by the plaintiff's participation in the `stall in' and `lock in' demonstrations."" 318 F. Supp., at 850. We do not intimate that this finding must be overturned after consideration on remand of respondent's 703 (a) (1) claim. We do, however, insist that respondent under 703 (a) (1) must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that whatever the stated reasons for his rejection, the decision was in reality racially premised.\n\n[ Footnote 19 ] The District Court may, for example, determine, after reasonable discovery that ""the [racial] composition of defendant's labor force is itself reflective of restrictive or exclusionary practices."" See Blumrosen, supra, at 92. We caution that such general determinations, while helpful, may not be in and of themselves controlling as to an individualized hiring decision, particularly in the presence of an otherwise justifiable reason for refusing to rehire. See generally United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 312 F. Supp. 977, 992 (WDNY 1970), order modified, 446 F.2d 652 (CA2 1971). Blumrosen, supra, n. 19, at 93.\n\n[ Footnote 20 ] See 463 F.2d, at 352.\n\n[ Footnote 21 ] It is, of course, a predictive evaluation, resistant to empirical proof, whether ""an applicant's past participation in unlawful conduct directed at his prospective employer might indicate the applicant's lack of a responsible attitude toward performing work for that employer."" 463 F.2d, at 353. But in this case, given the seriousness and harmful potential of respondent's participation in the ""stall-in"" and the accompanying inconvenience to other employees, it cannot be said that petitioner's refusal to employ lacked a rational and neutral business justification. As the Court has noted elsewhere:\n\n""Past conduct may well relate to present fitness; past loyalty may [411 U.S. 792, 807]   have a reasonable relationship to present and future trust."" Garner v.

POTTER, POSTMASTER GENERAL \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT \n</center>\n\nNo. 06&#8212;1321. Argued February 19, 2008&#8212;Decided May 27, 2008 \nPetitioner, a 45-year-old postal worker, filed suit claiming that her employer had violated the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §633a(a)&#8212;which requires that ""[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees . . . at least 40 years of age . . . be made free from any discrimination basedon age""&#8212;by subjecting her to various forms of retaliation after she filed an administrative ADEA complaint. The District Court granted respondent summary judgment. The First Circuit affirmed on the ground that §633a(a)'s prohibition of ""discrimination based on age"" does not cover retaliation. \n\nHeld: Section 633a(a) prohibits retaliation against a federal employee who complains of age discrimination. Pp. 3&#8212;16.\n\n(a) In so concluding, the Court follows the reasoning of two prior decisions ruling that retaliation is covered by similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes. First, in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229, 237, the Court held that a retaliation claim could be brought under 42 U. S. C. §1982, which provides that ""[a]llcitizens . . . shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."" While §1982 does not use the phrase ""discrimination based on race,"" that is its plain meaning. See, e.g., Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 177. Second, the Jackson Court, id., at 173&#8212;174, relied on Sullivan in holding that Title IX ofthe Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which prohibits ""discrimination"" ""on the basis of sex"" in educational programsreceiving federal aid, reached retaliation against a public school teacher for complaining about sex discrimination in his school's athletic program. 544 U. S., at 176&#8212;177. The ADEA language at issue (""discrimination based on age"") is not materially different from thelanguage at issue in Jackson and is the functional equivalent of the language at issue in Sullivan, see Jackson, supra, at 177. And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases: remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.Respondent neither asks the Court to overrule Sullivan or Jackson nor questions those decisions’ reasoning, and the Government, both in Jackson and in CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, p. ___, hasspecifically urged the Court to follow Sullivan’s reasoning. Pp. 3–6.\n(b) The three grounds on which the First Circuit sought to distin¬guish Jackson in support of the Circuit’s perception that there is aclear difference between causes of action for discrimination and for retaliation are not persuasive. Pp. 6–9.\n(1) The Circuit places too much reliance on the fact that theADEA expressly creates a private right of action, whereas the right of action under Title IX, the statute at issue in Jackson, is implied and not express, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677. The assertion that this distinction allowed the Jackson Court greaterleeway to adopt an expansive interpretation of Title IX improperlyconflates the analytically distinct questions whether a statute confers a private right of action and whether the statute’s substantive prohi¬bition reaches a particular form of conduct. Moreover, confusingthese questions would lead to exceedingly strange results. For exam¬ple, Title IX’s prohibition of “ discrimination” “on the basis of sex” ei¬ther does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a private right of ac¬tion cannot alter §1681(a)’s scope. Pp. 6–7.\n(2) Also unavailing is the Circuit’s attempt to distinguish Jackson on the ground that retaliation claims play a more important roleunder Title IX than under the ADEA. This argument ignores the ba¬sis for Jackson, which did not hold that Title IX prohibits retaliationbecause such claims are important as a policy matter, but, instead,relied on an interpretation of the “text of Title IX.” 544 U. S., at 173, \n\n178. Jackson’s statement that “teachers . . . are often in the best po¬sition to vindicate [student] rights,” id., at 181, did not address the question whether the statutory term “discrimination” encompassesretaliation, but was made in response to the school board’s argumentthat only a “victim of the discrimination,” not third parties, should beallowed to assert a retaliation claim, id., at 179–182. P. 8. \n(3) Finally, the Circuit’s attempt to distinguish Jackson on the ground that Title IX was adopted in response to Sullivan, whereas there is no evidence in the ADEA’s legislative history that §633a wasadopted in a similar context, is rejected. Jackson did not identify anylegislative history evidence, but merely observed that because “Con¬3 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nSyllabus \ngress enacted Title IX just three years after Sullivan,” it was “ ‘realis¬tic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan]and . . . expected [Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].”544 U. S., at 176. What Jackson said about the relationship between Sullivan and Title IX’s enactment can also be said about the relation¬ship between Sullivan and §633a’s enactment, since the latter provi¬sion was enacted just five years after Sullivan was decided and two years after Title IX was enacted. Pp. 8–9.\n(c) Respondent’s other arguments supporting the contention that§633a(a) does not encompass retaliation claims are rejected. Pp. 10– \n16. \n(1) Respondent places too much reliance on the presence of an ADEA provision specifically prohibiting retaliation against individu¬als complaining about private-sector age discrimination, §623(d), andthe absence of a similar provision in §633a. Because §§623 and 633a were enacted seven years apart rather than simultaneously, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330, and because they are couchedin very different terms—with §§623(a)(1)–(3) listing specific forbid¬den employer practices in contrast to §633a(a)’s broad prohibition of“discrimination”—the absence of a federal-sector provision similar to§623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart from Sullivan and Jackson. Pp. 10–12. \n(2) There is even less merit in respondent’s reliance on §633a(f),which provides that personnel actions by a federal entity covered by§633a “shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter” other than §633a and §631(b), which restricts ADEA cover¬age to persons at least 40 years old. Respondent’s contention that recognizing federal-sector retaliation claims would make §623(d) ap¬plicable to federal-sector employers in contravention of §633a(f) is unsound because the Court’s holding today is not based on §623(d) but on §633a(a) itself, “unaffected by other [ADEA] sections,” Lehman \nv. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 168. P. 13. \n(3) Also unavailing is respondent’s argument that the history of congressional and Executive Branch responses to discrimination infederal employment demonstrates that when Congress enacted§633a, it anticipated that the pre-existing reprisal regulations of theCivil Service Commission (CSC) would be extended to cover federal-sector age discrimination and be the exclusive avenue for assertingretaliation claims. This argument is not supported by direct evi¬dence, but rests on unsupported speculation, and, in any event, is self-contradictory in that, if §633a(a) does not confer an antiretalia¬tion right, there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the CSC to issue new regulations prohibiting retaliation. Pp. 13–14. \n\n(4) Respondent’s final argument—that sovereign immunity prin¬4 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nSyllabus \nciples require that §633a(a) be read narrowly as prohibiting substan¬tive age discrimination but not retaliation—is unpersuasive. The rule of construction requiring that “[a] waiver of the Federal Gov¬ernment’s sovereign immunity . . . be unequivocally expressed instatutory text” and “strictly construed . . . in favor of the sovereign,” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192, is satisfied here by §633a(c), whichunequivocally waives sovereign immunity for a claim brought by“[a]ny person aggrieved” by a §633a violation. Unlike §663a(c), §633a(a) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing “discrimination.” That the §633a(c) waiver ap¬plies to §633a(a) claims does not mean that §633a(a) must surmountthe same high hurdle as §633a(c). Pp. 15–16. \n476 F. 3d 54, reversed and remanded. \nALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS, KEN¬NEDY, SOUTER, GINSBURG, and BREYER, JJ., joined. ROBERTS, C.

JOHN E. POTTER, POSTMASTER GENERAL \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT \n[May 27, 2008] \nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court. \nThe question before us is whether a federal employee who is a victim of retaliation due to the filing of a complaint of age discrimination may assert a claim under the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), as added, 88 Stat. 74, and amended, 29 U. S. C. §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). We hold that such a claim is authorized. \nI Petitioner Myrna Gómez-Pérez was a window distribution clerk for the United States Postal Service. In October 2002, petitioner, then 45 years of age, was working full time at the Post Office in Dorado, Puerto Rico. She requested a transfer to the Post Office in Moca, Puerto Rico, in order to be closer to her mother, who was ill. The transfer was approved, and in November 2002, petitioner began working at the Moca Post Office in a part-time position. Later that month, petitioner requested a transfer back to her old job at the Dorado Post Office, but her supervisor converted the Dorado position to part-time, filled it with 2 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nanother employee, and denied petitioner’s application. \nAfter first filing an unsuccessful union grievance seeking a transfer back to her old job, petitioner filed a PostalService equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint. According to petitioner, she was then subjected to various forms of retaliation. Specifically, petitioner alleges that her supervisor called her into meetings during which groundless complaints were leveled at her,that her name was written on antisexual harassment posters, that she was falsely accused of sexual harassment, that her co-workers told her to “‘go back’” to whereshe “‘belong[ed],’” and that her work hours were drastically reduced. 476 F. 3d 54, 56 (CA1 2007).\nPetitioner responded by filing this action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, claiming, among other things, that respondent had violated thefederal-sector provision of the ADEA, 29 U. S. C. §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V), by retaliating against her for filing her equal employment opportunity age discrimination complaint. Respondent moved for summary judgment, arguing that the United States has not waived sovereign immunity for ADEA retaliation claims and that the ADEAfederal-sector provision does not reach retaliation. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the basis of sovereign immunity. \nOn appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for theFirst Circuit held that the Postal Reorganization Act, 39\nU. S. C. §401(1), unequivocally waived the Postal Service’s sovereign immunity, see 476 F. 3d, at 54, 57, but theCourt affirmed the decision of the District Court on the alternative ground that the federal-sector provision’sprohibition of “discrimination based on age,” §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V), does not cover retaliation, id., at 60, creating a split among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Forman v. Small, 271 F. 3d 285, 296 (CADC 2001) (ADEA federal-sector provision covers retaliation). We granted 3 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court \ncertiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2007). \nII The federal-sector provision of the ADEA provides that“[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees or applicantsfor employment who are at least 40 years of age . . . shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.” §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). The key question in this case is whether the statutory phrase “discrimination based onage” includes retaliation based on the filing of an age discrimination complaint. We hold that it does. In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by our prior decisions interpreting similar language in other antidiscrimination statutes. In Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969), we considered whether a claimof retaliation could be brought under Rev. Stat. §1978, 42\nU. S. C. §1982, which provides that “[a]ll citizens of theUnited States shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,and convey real and personal property.” While §1982 does not use the phrase “discrimination based on race,” that is its plain meaning. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U. S. 509, 561 (2004) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (describing §1982 as“banning public or private racial discrimination in the sale and rental of property”); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 \nU. S. 409 (1968).\nIn Sullivan, a white man (Sullivan) held membershipshares in a nonstock corporation that operated a park and playground for residents of the area in which he owned a home. Under the bylaws of the corporation, a member who leased a home in the area could assign a membership share in the corporation. But when Sullivan rented his house and attempted to assign a membership share to anAfrican-American (Freeman), the corporation disallowed the assignment because of Freeman’s race and subsequently expelled Sullivan from the corporation for protest4 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \ning that decision. Sullivan sued the corporation, and we held that his claim that he had been expelled “for theadvocacy of Freeman’s cause” was cognizable under §1982.396 U. S., at 237. A contrary holding, we reasoned, would have allowed Sullivan to be “punished for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities” and would have given “impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.” \nIbid. \nMore recently, in Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167 (2005), we relied on Sullivan in interpretingTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U. S. C. §1681 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Jackson, a public school teacher, sued his school board under Title IX, “alleging that the Board retaliated against him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school’s athletic program.” 544 \nU. S., at 171. Title IX provides in relevant part that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” §1681(a) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added). Holding that this provision prohibits retaliation, we wrote: \n“Retaliation against a person because that person hascomplained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination . . . . Retaliation is, bydefinition, an intentional act. It is a form of ‘discrimination’ because the complainant is being subjected todifferential treatment. Moreover, retaliation is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutesintentional ‘discrimination’ ‘on the basis of sex,’ in violation of Title IX.” Id., at 173–174 (citations omitted). 5 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court \nThis interpretation, we found, flowed naturally from Sullivan: “Retaliation for Jackson’s advocacy of the rights of the girls’ basketball team in this case is ‘discrimination’‘on the basis of sex,’ just as retaliation for advocacy onbehalf of a black lessee in Sullivan was discrimination on the basis of race.” 544 U. S., at 176–177. \nFollowing the reasoning of Sullivan and Jackson, we interpret the ADEA federal-sector provision’s prohibition of “discrimination based on age” as likewise proscribingretaliation. The statutory language at issue here (“discrimination based on age”) is not materially different fromthe language at issue in Jackson (“‘discrimination’” “‘on the basis of sex’”) and is the functional equivalent of thelanguage at issue in Sullivan, see Jackson, supra, at 177 (describing Sullivan as involving “discrimination on the basis of race”). And the context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases; that is, all three cases involve remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.\nThe Jackson dissent strenuously argued that a claim of retaliation is conceptually different from a claim of discrimination, see 544 U. S., at 184–185 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), but that view did not prevail.1 And respondent in thiscase does not ask us to overrule Sullivan or Jackson. Nor does respondent question the reasoning of those decisions. \n—————— 1Suggesting that we have retreated from the reasoning of Sullivan and Jackson, THE CHIEF JUSTICE, citing Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 63–65 (2006), states that “we have since explainedthat antidiscrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeedconceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes.” Post, at 4 (dissenting opinion). But as the Court explains today in CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, at 13, “[i]n Burlington . . . we used the status/conduct distinction to help explain why Congress might have wanted its explicitTitle VII antiretaliation provision to sweep more broadly (i.e., to include conduct outside the workplace) than its substantive Title VII (statusbased ) antidiscrimination provision. Burlington did not suggest that Congress must separate the two in all events.” 6 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nIndeed, in Jackson, the Government contended that “[t]he text . . . of Title IX demonstrate[s] that it encompassesprotection against retaliation” since “retaliation against aperson because that person has filed a sex discriminationcomplaint is a form of intentional sex discrimination.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8, in Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., O. T. 2004, No. 02–1672. Similarly, in another case this Term, the Government hasurged us to follow the reasoning of Sullivan and to hold that a claim of retaliation may be brought under Rev. Stat. §1977, 42 U. S. C. §1981. In that case, the Government argues that §1981’s prohibition of “‘discrimination’ . . . quite naturally includes discrimination on account ofhaving complained about discrimination.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10, in CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, O. T. 2007, No. 06–1431. \nIII The decision of the Court of Appeals, which respondent defends, perceived a “clear difference between a cause ofaction for discrimination and a cause of action for retaliation” and sought to distinguish Jackson on three grounds.476 F. 3d, at 58–59. We are not persuaded, however, by any of these attempted distinctions. \nA The Court of Appeals first relied on the fact that theADEA expressly creates a private right of action whereas Title IX, the statute at issue in Jackson, does not. See 476 \nF. 3d, at 58. The Court of Appeals appears to have reasoned that, because the private right of action under TitleIX is implied and not express, see Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), the Jackson Court had greater leeway to adopt an expansive interpretation ofTitle IX’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex. \nThis reasoning improperly conflates the question 7 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) Opinion of the Court \nwhether a statute confers a private right of action with thequestion whether the statute’s substantive prohibition reaches a particular form of conduct. These questions are analytically distinct, and confusing them would lead toexceedingly strange results.\nFor example, under the Court of Appeals’ reasoning,Title IX’s prohibition of “discrimination” “on the basis of sex,” in 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), might have a narrower scope and might not reach retaliation if Title IX contained a provision expressly authorizing an aggrieved private partyto bring suit to remedy a violation of §1681(a). We do not see how such a conclusion could be defended. Section 1681(a)’s prohibition of “discrimination” either does or does not reach retaliation, and the presence or absence of another statutory provision expressly creating a privateright of action cannot alter §1681(a)’s scope. In addition, it would be perverse if the enactment of a provision explicitly creating a private right of action—a provision that, ifanything, would tend to suggest that Congress perceived aneed for a strong remedy—were taken as a justification for narrowing the scope of the underlying prohibition. \nThe Court of Appeals’ reasoning also seems to lead tothe strange conclusion that, despite Jackson’s holding thata private party may assert a retaliation claim under TitleIX, the Federal Government might not be authorized toimpose upon an entity that engages in retaliation the administrative remedies, including the termination of funding, that are expressly sanctioned under §1682. It would be extremely odd, however, if §1681(a) had abroader scope when enforced by a means not expressly sanctioned by statute than it does when enforced by the means that the statute explicitly provides. For these reasons, we reject the proposition that Jackson may be distinguished from the present case on the ground that Title IX’s private right of action is implied. 8 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nB The Court of Appeals next attempted to distinguish Jackson on the ground that retaliation claims play a moreimportant role under Title IX than they do under the ADEA. The Court of Appeals pointed to our statement in Jackson that “‘teachers and coaches . . . are often in the best position to vindicate the rights of their studentsbecause they are better able to identify discrimination and bring it to the attention of administrators.’” 476 F. 3d, at 58 (quoting Jackson, 544 U. S., at 181). The Court of Appeals suggested that third parties are not needed to“identify instances of age discrimination and bring it tothe attention of supervisors” and that, consequently, there is no need to extend §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) to reachretaliation. 476 F. 3d, at 58. This argument ignores the basis for the decision in Jackson. Jackson did not hold that Title IX prohibitsretaliation because the Court concluded as a policy matter that such claims are important. Instead, the holding in Jackson was based on an interpretation of the “text of Title IX.” 544 U. S., at 173, 178. Moreover, the statements in Jackson on which the Court of Appeals relied did not address the question whether the statutory term “discrimination” encompasses retaliation. Instead, those statements addressed the school board’s argument that, even if Title IX was held to permit some retaliation claims, only a “victim of the discrimination”—and not third parties—should be allowed to assert such a claim. Id., at 179–182. It was in response to this argument that the Court noted the particular importance of reports of Title IX violations by third parties such asteachers and coaches. Id., at 181. \nC Finally, the Court of Appeals attempted to distinguish Jackson on the ground that “Title IX was adopted in re9 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court \nsponse to the Court’s holding in Sullivan,” whereas “there is no evidence in the legislative history that the ADEA’sfederal sector provisions were adopted in a similar context.” 476 F. 3d, at 58–59. Jackson’s reliance on Sullivan, however, did not stem from “evidence in the legislative history” of Title IX. Jackson did not identify any suchevidence but merely observed that “Congress enacted Title IX just three years after Sullivan was decided.” 544 U. S., at 176. Due to this chronology, the Court concluded, it was “‘not only appropriate but also realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan] and that it expected its enactment [of Title IX] to be interpreted in conformity with [it].” Ibid. (quoting Cannon, 441 \nU. S., at 699). See also 544 U. S., at 176 (“Title IX was enacted in 1972, three years after [Sullivan]”); id., at 179– 180 (“Sullivan . . . formed an important part of the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX”). \nWhat Jackson said about the relationship between Sullivan and the enactment of Title IX can be said as well about the relationship between Sullivan and the enactment of the ADEA’s federal-sector provision, 29 U. S. C.§633a (2000 ed. and Supp. V). Sullivan was decided in 1969 and §633a was enacted in 1974—five years after the decision in Sullivan and two years after the enactment of Title IX. We see no reason to think that Congress forgot about Sullivan during the two years that passed between the enactment of Title IX in 1972 and the enactment of §633a in 1974. And if, as Jackson presumed, Congresshad Sullivan in mind when it enacted Title IX in 1972, it is “appropriate” and “realistic” to presume that Congress expected its prohibition of “discrimination based on age” in§633a(a) “‘to be interpreted in conformity with’” its similarly worded prohibition of “discrimination” “on the basis of sex” in 20 U. S. C. §1681(a), which it had enacted justtwo years earlier. 544 U. S., at 176 (quoting Cannon, supra, at 699). 10 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nIV A \nIn arguing that §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) does not encompass retaliation claims, respondent relies principally on the presence of a provision in the ADEA specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals who complain about age discrimination in the private sector,§623(d), and the absence of a similar provision specifically prohibiting retaliation against individuals who complainabout age discrimination in federal employment. According to respondent, “the strong presumption is that [the] omission reflects that Congress acted intentionally and purposely in including such language in Section 623 of the Act and excluding it from Section 633a.” Brief for Respondent 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n“[N]egative implications raised by disparate provisionsare strongest” in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were “considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330 (1997). Here, the two relevant provisions were not considered or enacted together. Section 623(d), which specifically prohibits private sector retaliation, was enacted in 1967, see §4(d), 81 Stat.603, but the federal-sector provision, §633a, was not addeduntil 1974, see §28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74.2 \nRespondent’s argument is also undermined by the fact that the prohibitory language in the ADEA’s federal-sectorprovision differs sharply from that in the corresponding \n—————— 2The situation here is quite different from that which we faced in Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981), where both the private andfederal-sector provisions of the ADEA already existed and a single pieceof legislation—the 1978 amendments to the ADEA—added a provisionconferring a jury-trial right for private-sector ADEA suits but failed to include any similar provision for federal-sector suits. See Age Discrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1978, §4(a)(2), 92 Stat.\n189. 11 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court \nADEA provision relating to private-sector employment. In the private-sector provision, Congress set out a specific listof forbidden employer practices. See 29 U. S. C. §623(a).3 The omission from such a list of a specific prohibition of retaliation might have been interpreted as suggesting thatCongress did not want to reach retaliation, and thereforeCongress had reason to include a specific prohibition of retaliation, §623(d), in order to dispel any such inference.\nThe ADEA federal-sector provision, however, was not modeled after §623(d) and is couched in very different terms. The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned “directly after” Title VII’s federal-sector discriminationban. Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156, 167, n. 15 (1981). Like the ADEA’s federal-sector provision, TitleVII’s federal-sector provision, contains a broad prohibitionof “discrimination,” rather than a list of specific prohibitedpractices. Compare 118 Stat. 814, as amended, 42 U. S. C.§2000(e)–16(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (personnel actionsaffecting federal employees “shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”) with 29 U. S. C. §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) (personnel actions affecting federal employees who are at least 40 years of age “shall be made free from any discrimination based on age”). And like the ADEA’s federal\n—————— \n3Section 623(a) provides: “(a) Employer practices “It shall be unlawful for an employer— \n“(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age;\n“(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s age; or \n“(3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter.” 12 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nsector provision, Title VII’s federal-sector provision incorporates certain private-sector provisions but does not incorporate the provision prohibiting retaliation in theprivate sector. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–16(d) (incorporating §§2000e–5(f) to (k) but not §2000e–3(a), which forbidsprivate-sector retaliation).4 \nWhen Congress decided not to pattern 29 U. S. C. §633a(a) after §623(a) but instead to enact a broad, general ban on “discrimination based on age,” Congress was presumably familiar with Sullivan and had reason to expect that this ban would be interpreted “in conformity” with that precedent. Jackson, 544 U. S., at 176. Under the reasoning of Sullivan, retaliation for complainingabout age discrimination, is “discrimination based on age,” “just as retaliation for advocacy on behalf of [the] black lessee in Sullivan was discrimination on the basis of race.” Id., at 176–177. Thus, because §§623(d) and 633a wereenacted separately and are couched in very different terms, the absence of a federal-sector provision similar to§623(d) does not provide a sufficient reason to depart fromthe reasoning of Sullivan and Jackson.5 \n—————— 4While the federal-sector provision of Title VII does not incorporate §2000e–3(a), the federal-sector provision of Title VII does incorporate a remedial provision, §2000e–5(g)(2)(A), that authorizes relief for a violation of §2000–3(a). Petitioner argues that this remedial provisionshows that Congress meant for the Title VII federal-sector provision’s broad prohibition of “discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,or national origin” to reach retaliation because otherwise there wouldbe no provision banning retaliation in the federal sector and thus no way in which relief for retaliation could be awarded. Brief for Petitioner 20. The Federal Government, however, has declined to take a position on the question whether Title VII bans retaliation in federalemployment, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, and that issue is not before us inthis case. 5The Government’s theory that the absence of a provision specificallybanning federal-sector retaliation gives rise to the inference that §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) does not ban retaliation would lead logically to the strange conclusion that §633a(a) also does not forbid age13 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court B \nWe see even less merit in respondent’s reliance on 29 \nU. S. C. §633a(f), which provides that personnel actions by a federal department, agency, or other entity covered by§633a “shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter” other than §§633a and 631(b), the provision that restricts the coverage of the ADEA to persons who are at least 40 years of age. Respondent contendsthat recognizing federal-sector retaliation claims would be tantamount to making §623(d) applicable to federal-sector employers and would thus contravene §633a(f).\nThis argument is unsound because our holding that theADEA prohibits retaliation against federal-sector employees is not in any way based on §623(d). Our conclusion, instead, is based squarely on §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V) itself, “unaffected by other sections” of the Act. Lehman, supra, at 168. \nC Respondent next advances a complicated argumentconcerning “[t]he history of congressional and executivebranch responses to the problem of discrimination in federal employment.” Brief for Respondent 27. After Title VII was made applicable to federal employment in 1972,see Equal Employment Act, §11, 86 Stat. 111, the Civil Service Commission issued new regulations that prohibited discrimination in federal employment based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (but not age), see 5CFR §713.211 (1973), as well as “reprisal[s]” prompted bycomplaints about such discrimination, §713.262(a). When Congress enacted the ADEA’s federal-sector provisions in1974, respondent argues, Congress anticipated that the enactment of §633a would prompt the Civil Service Com\n—————— discriminatory job notices and advertisements because §633a(a), unlike§623(e) (2000 ed.), fails to mention such practices expressly. 14 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \nmission to “extend its existing reprisal regulations” tocover age discrimination complaints and that Congress intended for the civil service process to provide the exclusive avenue for asserting retaliation claims. Brief for Respondent 27, 33, and n. 7. Respondent suggests thatCongress took this approach because it believed that the Civil Service regulations “reflect[ed] a distinct set of public policy concerns in the civil service sector.” Id., at 27. \nRespondent cites no direct evidence that Congress actually took this approach;6 respondent’s argument rests on nothing more than unsupported speculation. And, in anyevent, respondent’s argument contradicts itself. If, as respondent maintains, “[s]ection 633a(a) does not confer an anti-retaliation right,” id., at 9, then there is no reason to assume that Congress expected the Civil Service Commission to respond to the enactment of §633a(a) by issuing new regulations prohibiting retaliation. On the contrary,if, as respondent maintains, Congress had declined toprovide an antiretaliation right, then Congress presumably would have expected the Civil Service Commission toabide by that policy choice. \n—————— 6Respondent asks us to infer that §633a(a) (2000 ed., Sup. V) does notproscribe retaliation because, when Congress made the ADEA applicable to the Federal Government, Congress did not simply subject theFederal Government to the ADEA’s private-employment provisions by amending the definition of “employer” to include the United States.Respondent contends that a similar inference may be drawn from the fact that in 1974 Congress added to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) a provision specifically making it unlawful to retaliateagainst an employee for attempting to vindicate FLSA rights. See §215(a)(3). These arguments fail to appreciate the significance of §633a(a)’s broad prohibition of “discrimination based on age.” Because Congress had good reason to expect that this broad ban would beinterpreted in the same way that Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 392 U. S. 657 (1968), had interpreted the broad ban on racial discrimination in 42 U. S. C. §1982, the inference that respondent asks us todraw is unfounded. 15 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nOpinion of the Court \nD Respondent’s final argument is that principles of sovereign immunity “require that Section 633a(a) be read narrowly as prohibiting substantive age discrimination, but not retaliation.” Id., at 44. Respondent contends that thebroad waiver of sovereign immunity in the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U. S. C. §401(1), is beside the point for present purposes because, for many federal agencies, the only provision that waives sovereign immunity for ADEAclaims is contained in §633a, and therefore this waiver provision “must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.” Brief for Respondent 44 (quoting United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992); internal quotation marks omitted). Respondent is of course correct that “[a] waiver of theFederal Government’s sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text” and “will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.” Lane v. Peña, 518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996). But this rule of construction is satisfied here. Subsection (c) of§633a unequivocally waives sovereign immunity for aclaim brought by “[a]ny person aggrieved” to remedy aviolation of §633a. Unlike §663a(c), §633a(a) (2000 ed.,Supp. V) is not a waiver of sovereign immunity; it is a substantive provision outlawing “discrimination.” That the waiver in §633a(c) applies to §633a(a) claims does not mean that §633a(a) must surmount the same high hurdle as §633a(c). See United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U. S. 465, 472–473 (2003) (where one statutory provision unequivocally provides for a waiver of sovereign immunity to enforce a separate statutory provision, thatlatter provision “‘need not . . . be construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of sovereign immunity’” (quoting United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 206, 218–219 (1983))).But in any event, even if §633a(a) must be construed in the same manner as §633a(c), we hold, for the reasons 16 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nOpinion of the Court \npreviously explained, that §633a(a) prohibits retaliationwith the requisite clarity. \n* * * For these reasons, we hold that §633a(a) prohibits retaliation against a federal employee who complains of agediscrimination. The judgment of the Court of Appeals isreversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. _________________ _________________ Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) 1 \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nNo. 06–1321 \nMYRNA GOMEZ-PEREZ, PETITIONER v. JOHN E. POTTER, POSTMASTER GENERAL \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT \n[May 27, 2008] \nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA and JUSTICE THOMAS join as to all but Part I, dissenting. \nThe Court today holds that the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act encom¬passes not only claims of age discrimination—which itslanguage expressly provides—but also claims of retaliation for complaining about age discrimination—which its lan¬guage does not. Protection against discrimination may include protection against retaliation for complainingabout discrimination, but that is not always the case. The separate treatment of each in the private-sector provisionof the ADEA makes that clear. In my view, the statutorylanguage and structure, as well as the fact that Congress has always protected federal employees from retaliationthrough the established civil service process, confirm thatCongress did not intend those employees to have a sepa¬rate judicial remedy for retaliation under the ADEA. I respectfully dissent. \nI Congress enacted the Age Discrimination in Employ¬ment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, which at the time applied only to private employers, with the purpose of “pro¬mot[ing] employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; . . . [of] prohibit[ing] arbitrary age 2 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \ndiscrimination in employment; [and of] help[ing] employ¬ers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.” 29 U. S. C. §621(b). The 1967 Act implemented this purpose in two principal ways. First, the statute made it unlawful for an employer to “discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.” §623(a)(1). Second, Congress enacted a specific antiretaliation provision,which made it “unlawful for an employer to discriminateagainst any of his employees or applicants for employment . . . because such individual . . . has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual. . . has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litiga¬tion under” the ADEA. §623(d).\nIn the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974 (FLSA Amendments), §28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 74, Congress(among other things) extended the ADEA to most Execu¬tive Branch employees by adopting 29 U. S. C. §633a.Like its private-sector counterpart, this federal-sectorprovision includes a ban on discrimination on the basis of age. Unlike its private-sector counterpart, the federal-sector provision does not include a separate ban on retalia¬tion. The federal-sector provision specifies only that “[a]llpersonnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age [in variousfederal agencies] shall be made free from any discrimina¬tion based on age.” §633a(a).\nDespite the absence of an express retaliation provisionin §633a(a), the Court finds that the statute encompassesboth discrimination and retaliation claims. To supportthis proposition, the Court principally relies on our deci¬sions in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969), and Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 \nU. S. 167 (2005). In my view, the majority reads thesecases for more than they are worth. 3 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nAs the majority correctly states, we held in Sullivan that 42 U. S. C. §1982, which prohibits race discriminationin the sale or rental of property, also provides a cause of action for retaliation.1 396 U. S., at 237. More recently,we held in Jackson that Title IX of the Education Amend¬ments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373—which provides in relevantpart that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on thebasis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financialassistance,” 20 U. S. C. §1681(a)—encompasses claims of retaliation for complaints about sex discrimination. 544 \nU. S., at 173–174. \nTo the extent the majority takes from these precedents the principle that broad antidiscrimination provisions may also encompass an antiretaliation component, I do not disagree. That is why I am able to join today’s opinion in CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, at 14 (holding that a retaliation claim is cognizable under 42 U. S. C. §1981). But it cannot be—contrary to the majority’s apparentview—that any time Congress proscribes “discrimination based on X,” it means to proscribe retaliation as well.That is clear from the private-sector provision of theADEA, which includes a ban on “discriminat[ion] against any individual . . . because of such individual’s age,” 29\nU. S. C. §623(a)(1), but also includes a separate (and \npresumably not superfluous) ban on retaliation, §623(d).Indeed, we made this precise observation in Jackson \n—————— 1To the extent there was any disagreement about whether Sullivan \nv. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229 (1969), was really a retalia¬tion case, or whether it dealt only with third-party standing, the view put forth by the Court won the day in Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167 (2005). Compare id., at 176, and n. 1, with id., at 194 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Whatever the merits of this disagree¬ment, I accept Jackson’s (and the Court’s) interpretation as a matter of stare decisis. See CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, at 3. 4 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nitself. The respondent in that case argued that Title IX’sban on discrimination could not include a cause of action for retaliation because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, like the private-sector provision of the ADEA, in¬cludes discrete discrimination and retaliation provisions. See 42 U. S. C. §§2000e–2 (discrimination), 2000e–3 (re¬taliation). We distinguished Title VII on the ground that“Title IX is a broadly written general prohibition on dis¬crimination,” while “Title VII spells out in greater detailthe conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute.” 544 U. S., at 175. Thus, while we distin¬guished Title VII from Title IX in Jackson, we also ac¬knowledged that not every express ban on discrimination must be read as a ban on retaliation as well. \nWhat is more, although the majority asserts that Jack¬son rejected the view that “a claim of retaliation is concep¬tually different from a claim of discrimination,” ante, at 5, we have since explained that antidiscrimination and antiretaliation provisions are indeed conceptually distinct, and serve distinct purposes. In Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53 (2006), we considered whether the antiretaliation provision in the Title VII private-sectorprovision, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a)—which is materially indistinguishable from that in the ADEA—applies “only [to] those employer actions and resulting harms that arerelated to employment or the workplace.” 548 U. S., at 61. In answering that question in the negative, we explained: \n“The antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against be¬cause of their [protected] status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through re¬taliation) with an employee’s efforts to secure or ad¬vance enforcement of the Act’s basic guarantees. The substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to indi¬5 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nviduals based on who they are, i.e., their status. The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to in¬dividuals based on what they do, i.e., their conduct.” Id., at 63 (citation omitted).2 \nWhile I take from Sullivan and Jackson the proposition that broad bans on discrimination, standing alone, may beread to include a retaliation component, the provision atissue here does not stand alone. And, as Jackson itself makes clear, see 544 U. S., at 173, 175, “the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809 (1989).Here the text and structure of the statute, the broader statutory scheme of which it is a part, and distinctions between federal- and private-sector employment convinceme that §633a(a) does not provide a cause of action for retaliation. \nII We have explained that “[w]here Congress includesparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally pre¬sumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marksomitted). If, as the majority holds, the ban on “discrimina¬\n—————— 2The Court views this discussion of Burlington as “[s]uggesting that [the Court has] retreated from the reasoning of Sullivan and Jackson.” Ante, at 5, n. 1. Not a bit. The discussion simply points out what Burlington plainly said: that there is a distinction between discrimina¬tion and retaliation claims. That does not mean Congress cannotaddress both in the same provision, as we held it did in Sullivan and Jackson and as we hold today it did in CBOCS West, Inc., ante, at 14. But it does confirm that Congress may choose to separate the two, asthe private-sector provision of the ADEA, as well as the portion of Title VII interpreted in Burlington, makes clear. 6 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \ntion based on age” in §633a(a) encompasses both discrimi¬nation and retaliation claims, it is difficult to understand why Congress would have felt the need to specify in §623 separate prohibitions against both “discriminat[ion]”“because of [an] individual’s age,” and retaliation. \nThe majority responds by noting that “‘[n]egative impli¬cations raised by disparate provisions are strongest’ inthose instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were ‘considered simultaneously when the language rais¬ing the implication was inserted.’” Ante, at 10 (quoting Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330 (1997)). Here, the majority notes that §623 was enacted in 1967, while §633a was not passed until 1974. Ante, at 10. Fair enough, but while I do not quarrel with this principle as a generalmatter, I do not think it does the work the majority thinksit does. Congress obviously had the private-sector ADEAprovision prominently before it when it enacted §633a, because the same bill that included §633a also amended the private-sector provision. See, e.g., §28(a)(2), 88 Stat.74 (amending the definition of “employer” in 29 U. S. C. §630(b) to include States and their political subdivisions).Indeed, it is quite odd to assume, as the majority does, see ante, at 9, 12, that the Congress that enacted §633a wasaware of and relied upon our decision in Sullivan—which interpreted 42 U. S. C. §1982, a wholly unrelated provi¬sion—but was not attuned to its own work reflected in the differences between 29 U. S. C. §§623 and 633a. Even if the negative implication to be drawn from those differ¬ences may not be at its “strongest” under these circum¬stances, it is certainly strong enough.\nMoreover, and more to the point, we have relied on thedifferences in language between the federal- and private-sector provisions of the ADEA specifically in our interpre¬tation of §633a. In Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981), we faced the question whether a person bringingan action under §633a(c), alleging a violation of §633a(a), 7 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nwas entitled to a trial by jury. In holding that there was no jury-trial right available against the Federal Govern¬ment, we relied on the fact that while the ADEA’s federal-sector provision did not include a provision for a jury trial,the analogous grant of a right of action in the private-sector provision, §626(c), “expressly provides for jury tri¬als.” Id., at 162. We reasoned that “Congress accordingly demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutoryright to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere inthe very ‘legislation cited.’ . . . But in [§633a(c)] it failed explicitly to do so.” Ibid. (quoting Galloway v. United States, 319 U. S. 372, 389 (1943)). So too here. “Congress. . . demonstrated that it knew how to” provide a retalia¬tion cause of action “when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very ‘legislation cited,’” but “failed explicitly to do so” in §633a(a).\nThe majority argues that this inference is weakened by the fact that, in “the private-sector provision, Congress setout a specific list of forbidden employer practices,” ante, at 11, while §633a(a) is a “broad, general ban on ‘discrimina¬tion based on age,’” ante, at 12. This point cuts against the majority. Section 623 drew a distinction between prohibited “employer practices” that discriminate based onage, and retaliation. See §§623(a) (discriminatory “[e]m¬ployer practices”), 623(d) (retaliation). Section 633a(a)phrased the prohibited discrimination in terms of “person¬nel actions.” Just as Congress did not regard retaliation as included within “employer practices,” but dealt with itseparately in §623(d), the counterpart to “employer prac¬tices” in §633a—discriminatory “personnel actions”— should similarly not be read to include retaliation.\nThe argument that some meaning ought to attach to Congress’s inclusion of an antiretaliation provision in §623 but not in §633a is further supported by several other factors. To begin with, Congress expressly made clear that the ADEA’s private-sector provisions should not apply to 8 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \ntheir federal-sector counterpart, by providing that “[a]nypersonnel action . . . referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provision of” the ADEA, except for one provision not relevant here. §633a(f). The majority sees no “merit in respondent’sreliance on 29 U. S. C. §633a(f).” Ante, at 13. But again,we relied on this very provision in Lehman. We explained that this subsection “clearly emphasize[s] that [§633a] wasself-contained and unaffected by other sections” of the ADEA, 453 U. S., at 168, a fact that we used to support our holding that the federal-sector provision does notprovide a right to a jury trial, even though the private-sector provision does. In short, Congress was aware thatthere were significant differences between the private-and federal-sector portions of the ADEA, and specified that no part of the former should be understood to have been implicitly imported into the latter. \nOther actions Congress took at the same time that itenacted §633a in 1974 further underscore the point that Congress deliberately chose to exclude retaliation claims from the ADEA’s federal-sector provision. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, as the Act’s name sug¬gests, dealt for the most part not with the ADEA, but withthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, extending thatstatute’s protections to federal employees. See FLSA Amendments, §6(a)(2), 88 Stat. 58. In doing so, Congressexplicitly subjected federal employers to the FLSA’s ex¬press antiretaliation provision, 29 U. S. C. §215(a)(3).Congress did not similarly subject the Federal Govern¬ment to the express antiretaliation provision in the ADEA, strongly suggesting that this was a conscious choice. \nThe majority responds that this “inference . . . is un¬founded” because “Congress had good reason to expect that this broad ban would be interpreted in the same way that Sullivan . . . had interpreted the broad ban on racial discrimination in 42 U. S. C. §1982.” Ante, at 14, n. 6. 9 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nAnything is possible, but again, it seems far more likely that Congress had its eye on the private-sector provision of the ADEA in crafting the federal one, rather than on oneof our precedents on a different statute. See supra, at 6. \nBut whatever the merits of this argument, it does notrebut the import of other probative provisions of the FLSA Amendments. In particular, Congress specifically chose in the FLSA Amendments to treat States and the Federal Government differently with respect to the ADEA itself.It subjected the former to the ADEA’s private-sector provi¬sion, see FLSA Amendments, §28(a)(2), 88 Stat. 74—including the express prohibition against retaliation in§623(d)—while creating §633a as a stand-alone prohibi¬tion against discrimination in federal employment, with¬out an antiretaliation provision, see §28(b)(2), ibid. This decision evinces a deliberate legislative choice not to ex¬tend those portions of the ADEA’s private-sector provi¬sions that are not expressly included in §633a, as of courseCongress specified in §633a(f).\nGiven all this, it seems safe to say that the text and structure of the statute strongly support the propositionthat Congress did not intend to include a cause of actionfor retaliation against federal employees in §633a(a). \nIII But why would Congress allow retaliation suits againstprivate-sector and state employers, but not against theFederal Government? The answer is that such retaliation was dealt with not through a judicial remedy, but ratherthe way retaliation in the federal workplace was typicallyaddressed—through the established civil service system, with its comprehensive protection for Government work¬ers. Congress was quite familiar with that detailed ad¬ministrative system—one that already existed for mostfederal employees, but not for private ones. This ap¬proach, unlike the Court’s, is consistent with the fact that 10 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nCongress has recognized that regulation of the civil serviceis a complex issue, requiring “careful attention to conflict¬ing policy considerations” and “balancing governmental efficiency and the rights of employees,” Bush v. Lucas, 462 \nU. S. 367, 388, 389 (1983). The resulting system oftenrequires remedies different from those found to be appro¬priate for the private sector (or even for the States). \nA Before Title VII was extended to federal employees in 1972, discrimination in federal employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was prohibitedby executive order. See Exec. Order No. 11478, 34 Fed. Reg. 12985 (1969). Civil service regulations implemented this policy by authorizing Executive Branch employees to bring administrative complaints for allegedly dis¬criminatory acts, including “personnel action[s],” 5 CFR§§713.211, 713.214(a)(1)(i) (1972). These regula-tions further provided that such complainants, their representatives, and witnesses “shall be free from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or re-prisal” for their involvement in the complaint proc¬ess. §§713.214(b) (complainants and representatives), 713.218(e) (witnesses). The Civil Service Commission (CSC) promulgated a detailed scheme through which federal employees couldvindicate these rights, including the express antiretalia¬tion protections. More serious personnel actions, known as “adverse actions,” could be challenged before the em¬ploying agency and appealed to the CSC, see §§713.219(a)and (b), 752.203, 771.202, 771.208, 771.222, while lessserious personnel actions and “any [other] matter of con¬cern or dissatisfaction” could be challenged under alterna¬tive procedures that were also appealable to the CSC, see§§713.217(b), 713.218, 713.219(a) and (c), 713.231(a),771.302(a). Retaliation was proscribed in all events. See, 11 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \ne.g., §§713.219(a) and (c) (incorporating Part 771 antire¬taliation provisions to complaint procedures except certainappeals to CSC); §§771.105(a)(1) and (b)(1), 771.211(e)(antiretaliation provisions for CSC appeals).\nIn 1972, Congress applied Title VII to the federal-sector,Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEO Act), §11, 86 Stat. 111, mandating that “[a]ll personnel actions” with respect to federal employees “shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, ornational origin.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–16(a). Congressempowered the CSC “to enforce the provisions of subsec¬tion (a) through appropriate remedies,” and to “issue suchrules, regulations, orders and instructions as it deemsnecessary and appropriate to carry out its responsibilitiesunder this section.” §2000e–16(b).\nUnder this grant of authority, as well as its prior au¬thority under statute and executive order, the CSC revisedits regulations both “to implement the [EEO Act] and tostrengthen the system of complaint processing.” 37 Fed. Reg. 22717 (1972) (Part 713 Subpart B). As with its prior system of administrative enforcement, the CSC distin¬guished between “complaints of discrimination on groundsof race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,” 5 CFR §713.211 (1973), on the one hand, and charges by a “com¬plainant, his representative, or a witness who allegesrestraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or repri¬sal in connection with the presentation of a complaint,”§713.262(a), on the other. The regulations imposed uponemploying agencies the obligation of “timely investigation and resolution of complaints including complaints of coer¬cion and reprisal,” 37 Fed. Reg. 22717; see also 5 CFR §713.220, and made clear the procedures for processing retaliation claims, §§713.261, 713.262. The regulationsfurther mandated that the CSC “require the [employing] agency to take whatever action is appropriate” with re¬spect to allegations of retaliation if the agency itself has 12 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \n“not completed an appropriate inquiry,” §713.262(b)(1).\nThus, leading up to the enactment of 29 U. S. C. §633a in 1974, the CSC’s comprehensive regulatory scheme set forth a broadly applicable remedy for retaliation against federal employees for filing complaints or otherwise par¬ticipating in the EEO process. And when Congress em¬powered the CSC in 1974 to “enforce the provisions of [§633a(a)] through appropriate remedies,” and to “issue such rules, regulations, orders, and instructions as itdeems necessary and appropriate to carry out its respon¬sibilities” under that statute, §28(b)(2), 88 Stat. 75, the assumption that Congress expected the CSC to create an administrative antiretaliation remedy, just as it had forcomplaints of discrimination under Title VII, is compel¬ling. And sure enough, the CSC did just that promptlyafter §633a was enacted. See 39 Fed. Reg. 24351 (1974); 5 CFR §713.511 (1975).\nGiven this history of addressing retaliation throughadministrative means, combined with the complicatednature (relative to the private sector) of federal personnel practices, it is therefore by no means anomalous that Congress would have dealt with the “primary objective” ofcombating age discrimination through a judicial remedy, Burlington, 548 U. S., at 63, but left it to expert adminis¬trators used to dealing with personnel matters in thefederal work force to “secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering (through retalia¬tion) with an employee’s efforts to secure or advance en¬forcement of the Act’s basic guarantees,” ibid. \nB The majority discounts the above argument as “unsup¬ported speculation.” Ante, at 14. It seems to me that the fact that the Executive Branch had always treated dis¬crimination and retaliation as distinct, and that it enacted administrative remedies for retaliation almost immedi¬13 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nately after the passage of the Title VII and ADEA federal-sector provisions, provide plenty of support. But even if the majority is right, the view that Congress intended totreat retaliation for age discrimination complaints as aproblem to be dealt with primarily through administrative procedures, rather than through the judicial process in thefirst instance, is confirmed by Congress’s passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 92 Stat. 1111.\nThe CSRA, as amended, has a detailed comprehensive antiretaliation provision, which generally makes it unlaw¬ful for Executive Branch employers to \n“take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or appli¬cant for employment because of . . . (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted byany law, rule, or regulation [or] (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the ex¬ercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A).” 5 \nU. S. C. §2302(b)(9).3 \nThis antiretaliation provision, which plainly applies to retaliation for exercising rights under the civil rightsstatutes, including the ADEA, is supported by a host ofadministrative remedies. If the alleged retaliation resultsin adverse actions such as removal, suspension for morethan 14 days, or reduction in pay, see §7512, an appeal can be taken directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), §§7513(d), 7701, with judicial review in theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \n—————— 3Neither 29 U. S. C. §633a nor the CSRA cover employees of Con¬gress or of the Executive Office of the President and Executive Resi¬dence of the White House. See §633a(a); 5 U. S. C. §2302(a)(2)(B). But Congress has expressly extended the protections of the ADEA to suchemployees, 2 U. S. C. §1311(a)(2) (Congress); 3 U. S. C. §411(a)(2)(White House), and provided them with an express retaliation remedy,2 U. S. C. §1317; 3 U. S. C. §417(a). 14 GOMEZ-PEREZ v. POTTER \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \n§7703(b)(1). Retaliation claims based on less serious allegations are first investigated by the Office of Special Counsel. If the Office finds that there are reasonable grounds supporting the retaliation charge, it must report its determination to, and may seek corrective action from, the MSPB. §§1214(a)(1)(A), (b)(2)(B), (C), and 1214(c). Again, judicial review in the Federal Circuit is available. §7703(b)(1). In all events, upon a finding that retaliationhas in fact occurred, the MSPB has the authority to ordercorrective action, §§1214(b)(4), 7701(b)(2), to order attor¬ney’s fees on appeal, §7701(g), and to discipline federalemployees responsible for retaliatory acts, §1215.4 \nTo be sure, the CSRA was enacted after §633a. Never¬theless, we have explained, in the same context of federal employee remedies, that the “classic judicial task of recon¬ciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to ‘make sense’ in combination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implica¬tions of a later statute.” United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988). That is precisely the situation here.\nIndeed, this is particularly true with respect to Con¬gress’s regulation of federal employment. We have ex¬plained that the CSRA is an “integrated scheme of admin¬istrative and judicial review, designed to balance thelegitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient admini¬stration.” Id., at 445. Perhaps the CSRA’s “civil service remedies [are] not as effective as an individual damagesremedy” that can be obtained in federal court, Bush, 462 \nU. S., at 372, or perhaps a quicker and more familiar administrative remedy is more effective as a practical —————— \n4The Postal Service—Gomez-Perez’s employer—operates under its own personnel system.

S. ____ (2008) \nROBERTS, C. J., dissenting \nmatter. That is not the issue. Cf. id., at 388 (the question whether a judicial remedy against a federal employer for a First Amendment violation should be implied “obviously cannot be answered simply by noting that existing reme¬dies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff”). The CSRA establishes an “elaborate, comprehensive scheme that encompasses substantive provisions forbiddingarbitrary action by supervisors and procedures—administrative and judicial—by which improper action may be redressed.” Id., at 385. Retaliation as a generalmatter was already addressed for federal employees. I would not read into §633a a judicial remedy for retaliationwhen Congress—which has “developed considerable fa¬miliarity with balancing governmental efficiency and therights of employees,” id., at 389—chose to provide a de¬tailed administrative one. \n* * * \nThe question whether a ban against “discriminationbased on” a protected status such as age can also be readto encompass a ban on retaliation can be answered only after careful scrutiny of the particular provision in ques¬tion. In this case, an analysis of the statutory language of§633a and the broader scheme of which it is a part con¬firms that Congress did not intend implicitly to create a judicial remedy for retaliation against federal employees, when it did so expressly for private-sector employees. Congress was not sloppy in creating this distinction; it didso for good reason: because the federal workplace is gov¬erned by comprehensive regulation, of which Congresswas well aware, while the private sector is not. \nFor these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals. _________________ _________________ Cite as: 553 U.

I write separately to reiterate my view that Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167 (2005), incorrectly conflated the concepts of retaliation and discrimination. The text of the federal-sector provision of the Age Dis¬crimination in Employment Act of 1967 is clear: It prohib¬its only “discrimination based on age.” 29 U. S. C. §633a(a) (2000 ed., Supp. V). If retaliation is not “dis¬crimination on the basis of sex,” Jackson, supra, at 185 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), or “discrimination based on race,” CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, ante, at 4 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), it is certainly not “discriminationbased on age.” Because §633a(a) provides no basis for implying a private right of action for retaliation claims, and its context only reaffirms its plain meaning, see ante, at 5–9 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.

METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\nNo. 06&#8212;1595. Argued October 8, 2008&#8212;Decided January 26, 2009\n</center>\n\nIn response to questions from an official of respondent local government (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual harassment by the Metro School District employee relations director (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that Hughes had sexually harassed her. Metro took no action against Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement. She filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes's behavior, in violation of 42 U. S. C. §2000e&#8212;3(a), which makes it unlawful ""for an employer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e]"" who (1) ""has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter"" (opposition clause), or (2) ""has made a charge, testified, assisted, orparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter"" (participation clause). The court granted Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the opposition clause demanded ""active, consistent"" opposing activities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not cover Metro's internal investigation because it was not conducted pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nHeld: The antiretaliation provision's protection extends to an employee who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but inanswering questions during an employer's internal investigation. Because ""oppose"" is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dic-tionary meaning of resisting or contending against. Crawford’s statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disapproving account of Hughes's sexually obnoxious behavior toward her. ""Oppose"" goes beyond ""active, consistent"" behavior in ordinary discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Thus, a person can ""oppose"" by responding to someone else's questions just as surely as by provoking the discussion. Nothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination onher own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination inthe same words when asked a question. Metro unconvincingly argues for the Sixth Circuit's active, consistent opposition rule, claiming that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go badly for an employee who responded to enquiries. Employers, however, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to discriminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807, hold ""[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee."" The Circuit’s rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along with the statute's "" 'primary objective' "" of ""avoid[ing] harm"" to employees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting discrimination in answer to an employer's questions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep quiet about Title VII offenses. Because Crawford’s conduct is covered by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.

We hold that it does.\nI In 2002, respondent Metropolitan Government of Nash-ville and Davidson County, Tennessee (Metro), began looking into rumors of sexual harassment by the MetroSchool District’s employee relations director, Gene Hughes.1 211 Fed.

When\n——————\n1Because this case arises out of the District Court’s grant of sum-mary judgment for Metro, “we are required to view all facts and drawall reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, [Crawford].” Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam).\n2 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nOpinion of the Court\nVeronica Frazier, a Metro human resources officer, asked petitioner Vicky Crawford, a 30-year Metro employee, whether she had witnessed “inappropriate behavior” on the part of Hughes, id., at 374–375, Crawford described several instances of sexually harassing behavior: once,Hughes had answered her greeting, “‘Hey Dr. Hughes, what’s up?,’” by grabbing his crotch and saying “‘[Y]ouknow what’s up’”; he had repeatedly “‘put his crotch up to[her] window’”; and on one occasion he had entered her office and “‘grabbed her head and pulled it to his crotch,’” id., at 375, and n. 1. Two other employees also reported being sexually harassed by Hughes. Id., at 375. AlthoughMetro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawfordand the two other accusers soon after finishing the inves-tigation, saying in Crawford’s case that it was for embez-zlement. Ibid. Crawford claimed Metro was retaliatingfor her report of Hughes’s behavior and filed a charge of aTitle VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportu-nity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in theUnited States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. Ibid.\nThe Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses,making it “an unlawful employment practice for an em-ployer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . [1] because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or [2] because hehas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated inany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The one is known as the “opposition clause,” the other as the “par-ticipation clause,” and Crawford accused Metro of violat-ing both.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for Metro. It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposi-tion clause because she had not “instigated or initiated any complaint,” but had “merely answered questions by\nCite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009) 3\nOpinion of the Court\ninvestigators in an already-pending internal investigation,initiated by someone else.” Memorandum Opinion, No. 3:03–cv–00996 (MD Tenn., Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 16a–17a. It concluded that her claim also failed under the participation clause, which Sixth Circuit prece-dent confined to protecting “‘an employee’s participationin an employer’s internal investigation . . . where that investigation occurs pursuant to a pending EEOC charge’” (not the case here). Id., at 15a (emphasis omitted) (quot-ing Abbott v. Crown Motor Co., 348 F. 3d 537, 543 (CA6 2003)).\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed on the same grounds, holding that the opposition clause “‘demands active, con-sistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . . protection against retaliation,’” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting Bell\nv. Safety Grooving & Grinding, LP, 107 Fed. Appx. 607,610 (CA6 2004)), whereas Crawford did “not claim to haveinstigated or initiated any complaint prior to her partici-pation in the investigation, nor did she take any further action following the investigation and prior to her firing.” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376. Again like the trial judge, the Court of Appeals understood that Crawford could show no violation of the participation clause because her “‘em-ployer’s internal investigation’” was not conducted “‘pur-suant to a pending EEOC charge.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Abbott, supra, at 543).\nBecause the Sixth Circuit’s decision conflicts with those of other Circuits, particularly as to the opposition clause, see, e.g., McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA71996), we granted Crawford’s petition for certiorari. 552\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse and remand for further proceedings.\nII The opposition clause makes it “unlawful . . . for anemployer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e] . . .\n4 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nOpinion of the Court\nbecause he has opposed any practice made . . . unlawful. . . by this subchapter.” §2000e–3(a). The term “oppose,”being left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinarymeaning, Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979): “to resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; to con-front; resist; withstand,” Webster’s New International Dictionary 1710 (2d ed. 1958). Although these actionsentail varying expenditures of energy, “RESIST frequentlyimplies more active striving than OPPOSE.” Ibid.; see also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1359 (2d ed. 1987) (defining “oppose” as “to be hostile or adverseto, as in opinion”).\nThe statement Crawford says she gave to Frazier is thuscovered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disap-proving account of sexually obnoxious behavior toward her by a fellow employee, an answer she says antagonized her employer to the point of sacking her on a false pretense. Crawford’s description of the louche goings-on wouldcertainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as “resist[ant]” or “antagoni[stic]” to Hughes’s treatment, iffor no other reason than the point argued by the Govern-ment and explained by an EEOC guideline: “When an employee communicates to her employer a belief that theemployer has engaged in . . . a form of employment dis-crimination, that communication” virtually always “consti-tutes the employee’s opposition to the activity.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9 (citing 2 EEOC Compli-ance Manual §§8–II–B(1), (2), p. 614:0003 (Mar. 2003)); see also Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 8) (explaining that EEOC compli-ance manuals “reflect ‘a body of experience and informedjudgment to which courts and litigants may properlyresort for guidance’” (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 642 (1998))). It is true that one can imagine excep-tions, like an employee’s description of a supervisor’s racist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases,\nCite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009) 5\nOpinion of the Court\nand this is not one of them.2\nThe Sixth Circuit thought answering questions fell short of opposition, taking the view that the clause “‘demands active, consistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . . protection against retaliation,’” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting Bell, supra, at 610), and that an employee must “instigat[e] or initiat[e]” a complaint to be covered, 211 Fed. Appx., at 376. But though these requirements obvi-ously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they are not limits of it.\n“Oppose” goes beyond “active, consistent” behavior in ordinary discourse, where we would naturally use theword to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Countless peoplewere known to “oppose” slavery before Emancipation, or are said to “oppose” capital punishment today, withoutwriting public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting the government. And we would call it “opposition” if anemployee took a stand against an employer’s discrimina-tory practices not by “instigating” action, but by standingpat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire ajunior worker for discriminatory reasons. Cf. McDonnell, supra, at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliatedagainst him for failing to prevent his subordinate from filing an EEOC charge). There is, then, no reason to doubt that a person can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s\n—————— 2Metro suggests in passing that it was unclear whether Crawfordactually opposed Hughes’s behavior because some of her defensive responses were “inappropriate,” such as telling Hughes to “bite me” and“flip[ping] him a bird.” Brief for Respondent 1–2 (internal quotation marks omitted). This argument fails not only because at the summary judgment stage we must “view all facts and draw all reasonable infer-ences in [Crawford’s] favor,” Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 195, n. 2, but also because Crawford gave no indication that Hughes’s gross clowning was anything but offensive to her.\n6 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nOpinion of the Court\nquestion just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protectingan employee who reports discrimination on her own initia-tive but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same words when her boss asks a question.\nMetro and its amici support the Circuit panel’s insis-tence on “active” and “consistent” opposition by arguingthat the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likelyit is that employers will look into what may be happening outside the executive suite. As they see it, if retaliation is an easy charge when things go bad for an employeewho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid theheadache by refusing to raise questions about possible discrimination.\nThe argument is unconvincing, for we think it underes-timates the incentive to enquire that follows from ourdecisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\nU. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998). Ellerth and Faragher hold “[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee.” Ellerth, supra, at 765; Faragher, supra, at 807. Although there is no af-firmative defense if the hostile environment “culminates in a tangible employment action” against the employee, Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense “[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken” if it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptlyany” discriminatory conduct and “the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise,” ibid. Employers are thus subjectto a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any discriminatory activity in their operations as a way tobreak the circuit of imputed liability. Ibid.; see also Brief for Petitioner 24–28, and nn. 31–35 (citing studies demon-\nCite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009) 7\nOpinion of the Court\nstrating that Ellerth and Faragher have prompted manyemployers to adopt or strengthen procedures for investi-gating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory con-duct). The possibility that an employer might someday want to fire someone who might charge discrimination traceable to an internal investigation does not strike us aslikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher affirmative defense.\nThat aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit’srule would not itself largely undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along with the statute’s “‘primary objec-tive’” of “avoid[ing] harm” to employees. Faragher, supra, at 806 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 417 (1975)). If it were clear law that an employee who reported discrimination in answering an employer’s questions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep quiet about Title VII offenses against themselves or against others.This is no imaginary horrible given the documented indi-cations that “[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why people stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about bias and discrimination.” Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn.\nL. Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also id., at 37, and n. 58 (compil-ing studies). The appeals court’s rule would thus create areal dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile work environment if the boss took steps to assure a de-fense under our cases. If the employee reported discrimi-nation in response to the enquiries, the employer might well be free to penalize her for speaking up. But if she kept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a TitleVII claim, the employer might well escape liability, argu-ing that it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and cor-rect [any discrimination] promptly” but “the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of . . .preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.” Ellerth, supra, at 765. Nothing in the statute’s\n8 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nOpinion of the Court\ntext or our precedent supports this catch-22.3\nBecause Crawford’s conduct is covered by the opposition clause, we do not reach her argument that the Sixth Cir-cuit misread the participation clause as well. But that does not mean the end of this case, for Metro’s motion for summary judgment raised several defenses to the retalia-tion charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the Dis-trict Court never reached these others owing to its rulingon the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on remand.\nIII The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n—————— 3Metro also argues that “[r]equiring the employee to actually initiatea complaint . . . conforms with the employee’s ‘obligation of reasonablecare to avoid harm’ articulated in Faragher and Ellerth.” Brief for Respondent 28 (quoting Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807 (1998)). But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees who are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by“tak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer,” ibid.; it is based on the general principle “that a victim has a duty ‘to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize . . . damages,’ ” id., at 806 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). We have never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to reportdiscrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative,let alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak. Extending the mitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees willoften face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselvesface, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others. Thus, they are not “victims” of anything until they are retaliated against, and it wouldbe absurd to require them to “mitigate” damages they may be unawarethey will suffer.\n_________________\n_________________\nCite as: 555 U.

METRO-\nPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE\nAND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\nAPPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n[January 26, 2009]\nJUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,concurring in the judgment.\nThe question in this case is whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. §2000e et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), prohibits retaliation against an employee who testifies in an inter-nal investigation of alleged sexual harassment. I agreewith the Court that the “opposition clause” of §2000e–3(a)(2000 ed.) prohibits retaliation for such conduct. I also agree with the Court’s primary reasoning, which is based on “the point argued by the Government and explained by an EEOC guideline: ‘When an employee communicates toher employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . . a form of employment discrimination, that communication’virtually always ‘constitutes the employee’s opposition to the activity.’” Ante, at 4. I write separately to emphasize my understanding that the Court’s holding does not and should not extend beyond employees who testify ininternal investigations or engage in analogous purposiveconduct.\nAs the Court concludes, the term “oppose” does notdenote conduct that necessarily rises to the level requiredby the Sixth Circuit—i.e., conduct that is “‘consistent’” and “instigated or initiated” by the employee. 211 Fed.\n2 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nALITO, J., concurring in judgment\nAppx. 373, 376 (2006). The primary definitions of the term “oppose” do, however, require conduct that is active and purposive. See Webster’s New International Diction-ary 1709–1710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary ofthe English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter RandomDict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866–867 (2d ed. 1989). For example, the first three definitions of the termin the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies are as follows:\n“1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2.to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an opponent or adversary.” Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed.1987).\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends that the statutory term “oppose” means “taking action(including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress, or correct unlawful discrimination.” Brief for Petitioner\n40.\nIn order to decide the question that is before us, we haveno need to adopt a definition of the term “oppose” that is broader than the definition that petitioner advances. But in dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in the Random House Dictionary of the English Languagegoes further, defining “oppose” to mean “‘to be hostile or adverse to, as in opinion.’” Ante, at 4 (emphasis added).Thus, this definition embraces silent opposition.\nWhile this is certainly an accepted usage of the term“oppose,” the term is not always used in this sense, and it is questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the opposition clause of 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). It is notewor-thy that all of the other conduct protected by this provi-sion—making a charge, testifying, or assisting or partici-pating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing—requires active and purposive conduct. “‘That several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of\nCite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009) 3\nALITO, J., concurring in judgment\ninterpreting the other items as possessing that attributeas well.’” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006) (quoting Beecham v. United States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994)).\nAn interpretation of the opposition clause that protectsconduct that is not active and purposive would have im-portant practical implications. It would open the door to retaliation claims by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers. To be sure, in manycases, such employees would not be able to show that management was aware of their opposition and thuswould not be able to show that their opposition caused the adverse actions at issue. But in other cases, such employ-ees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue onthe question of causation. Suppose, for example, that anemployee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while informally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbialwater cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that was overheard by a co-worker. Or suppose that an em-ployee alleges that such a conversation occurred after work at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workersor at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relativeof a supervisor.\nSome courts hold that an employee asserting a retalia-tion claim can prove causation simply by showing that theadverse employment action occurred within a short timeafter the protected conduct. See, e.g., Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U. S. 268, 273 (2001) (per curiam)(noting that some cases “accept mere temporal proximity between an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence ofcausality to establish a prima facie case”); see also Gorman-Bakos v. Cornell Cooperative Extension of Schenectady Cty., 252 F. 3d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); Conner\nv. Schnuk Markets, Inc., 121 F. 3d 1390, 1395 (CA10 1997); Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F. 3d 1446, 1458\n4 CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\nNASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY.\nALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n(CA7 1994). As a result, an employee claiming retaliationmay be able to establish causation simply by showing that,within some time period prior to the adverse action, theemployer, by some indirect means, became aware of the views that the employee had expressed. Where the pro-tected conduct consisted of a private conversation, applica-tion of this rule would be especially problematic because ofuncertainty regarding the point in time when the em-ployer became aware of the employee’s private expressionsof disapproval.\nThe number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC has proliferated in recent years. See U. S. Equal Em-ployment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:FY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/ charges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY 1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited Jan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file) (showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOCdoubled between 1992 and 2007). An expansive interpre-tation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause this trend to accelerate.\nThe question whether the opposition clause shields employees who do not communicate their views to theiremployers through purposive conduct is not before us in this case; the answer to that question is far from clear;and I do not understand the Court’s holding to reach that issue here. For present purposes, it is enough to hold that the opposition clause does protect an employee, like peti-tioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal investigation.",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6477,,LawOpinionsResearch,OpinionSCOTUS,LongText,4,,,"<center><b>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES </b>\nGROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT \n</center>\n\nNo. 08–441. Argued March 31, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009 \n\nPetitioner Gross filed suit, alleging that respondent (FBL) demoted himin violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967(ADEA), which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee “because of such individual’s age,” 29 \nU. S. C. §623(a). At the close of trial, and over FBL’s objections, theDistrict Court instructed the jury to enter a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was demoted andhis age was a motivating factor in the demotion decision, and told thejury that age was a motivating factor if it played a part in the demotion. It also instructed the jury to return a verdict for FBL if it proved that it would have demoted Gross regardless of age. The juryreturned a verdict for Gross. The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, for cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964 when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations—i.e., a “mixed-motives” case. \nHeld: A plaintiff bringing an ADEA disparate-treatment claim mustprove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the “but-for” cause of the challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision. Pp. 4–12. \n(a) Because Title VII is materially different with respect to therelevant burden of persuasion, this Court’s interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as Price Water2 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nSyllabus \nhouse and Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 94–95. This Court has never applied Title VII’s burden-shifting framework toADEA claims and declines to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, the Court “must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike Title VII, which has been amended to explicitly authorize discrimination claims where an improper consideration was “a motivating factor” for the adverse action, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), the ADEA does not provide that a plaintiffmay establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it added §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B) to Title VII, even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA inseveral ways. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256, and “negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest” where the provisions were “considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330. Pp. 5–6.\n(b) The ADEA’s text does not authorize an alleged mixed-motivesage discrimination claim. The ordinary meaning of the ADEA’s requirement that an employer took adverse action “because of” age is that age was the “reason” that the employer decided to act. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610. To establish a disparate-treatment claim under this plain language, a plaintiff mustprove that age was the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse decision. See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___. It follows that under §623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that “but-for” cause. This Court has previously held this to be the burden’s proper allocation in ADEA cases, see, e.g., Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ___– ___, ___–___, and nothing in the statute’s text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception for a subset of ADEA cases. Where a statute is “silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,” “theordinary default rule [is] that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing toprove their claims.” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56. Hence, the burden of persuasion is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. Pp. 7–9.\n(c) This Court rejects petitioner’s contention that the proper interpretation of the ADEA is nonetheless controlled by Price Waterhouse, which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted inalleged mixed-motives Title VII claims. It is far from clear that the \n3 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) Syllabus \nCourt would have the same approach were it to consider the questiontoday in the first instance. Whatever Price Waterhouse’s deficiencies in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case wasdecided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply. The problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47.

FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n[June 18, 2009] \nJUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court. \nThe question presented by the petitioner in this case iswhether a plaintiff must present direct evidence of age discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives juryinstruction in a suit brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. §621 et seq. Because we hold that such a jury instruction is never proper in an ADEA case,we vacate the decision below. \nI Petitioner Jack Gross began working for respondentFBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971. As of 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director.But in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the position of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL transferred many of Gross’ job responsibilities to a newly created position—claims administration manager. That position was given to LisaKneeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross and who was then in her early forties. App. to Pet. forCert. 23a (District Court opinion). Although Gross (in his 2 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nnew position) and Kneeskern received the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion because of FBL’s reallocation of his former job responsibilities to Kneeskern. \nIn April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee “because of such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a). The case proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL defended its decision on the grounds that Gross’ reassignment was part of a corporate restructuring and that Gross’ new position wasbetter suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion). \nAt the close of trial, and over FBL’s objections, theDistrict Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of theevidence, that FBL “demoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator” and that his “age was a motivating factor” inFBL’s decision to demote him. App. 9–10. The jury wasfurther instructed that Gross’ age would qualify as a “‘motivating factor,’ if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]’sdecision to demote [him].” Id., at 10. The jury was alsoinstructed regarding FBL’s burden of proof. According tothe District Court, the “verdict must be for [FBL] . . . if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that[FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.” Ibid. The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him$46,945 in lost compensation. Id., at 8. \nFBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standardestablished in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 3 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nOpinion of the Court \n(1989). See 526 F. 3d 356, 358 (2008). In Price Waterhouse, this Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 \nU. S. C. §2000e et seq., when an employee alleges that hesuffered an adverse employment action because of bothpermissible and impermissible considerations—i.e., a “mixed-motives” case. 490 U. S., at 232, 244–247 (plurality opinion). The Price Waterhouse decision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see id., at 231–258, Justices White and O’Connor separately concurred in the judgment, see id., at 258–261 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 261–279 (opinion of O’Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see id., at 279–295 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a “motivating” or a “ ‘substantial’” factor in the employer’s action,the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer toshow that it would have taken the same action regardlessof that impermissible consideration. See id., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259–260 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). Justice O’Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee must present “direct evidence that anillegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision.” Id., at 276. \nIn accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals identified Justice O’Connor’s opinion as controlling. See 526 F. 3d, at 359 (citing Erickson v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 271 F. 3d 718, 724 (CA8 2001)). Applying thatstandard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to present “[d]irect evidence . . . sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.”526 F. 3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court of Appeals’ view, “direct evidence” is only that 4 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \nevidence that “show[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, shouldthe burden shift to the employer “‘to convince the trier offact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor.’” Ibid. (quoting Price Waterhouse, supra, at 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.)). \nThe Court of Appeals thus concluded that the DistrictCourt’s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance of any category of evidence showing that agewas a motivating factor—not just “direct evidence” related to FBL’s alleged consideration of age. See 526 F. 3d, at \n360. Because Gross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appealsheld that the District Court should not have given the mixed-motives instruction. Ibid. Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion applicable totypical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus shouldhave been instructed only to determine whether Gross hadcarried his burden of “prov[ing] that age was the determining factor in FBL’s employment action.” See ibid. \nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals. \nII The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiffmust “present direct evidence of discrimination in order toobtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII discrimination case.” Pet. for Cert. i. Before reaching thisquestion, however, we must first determine whether the burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an alleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under 5 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nOpinion of the Court \nthe ADEA.1 We hold that it does not. \nA Petitioner relies on this Court’s decisions construingTitle VII for his interpretation of the ADEA. Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not control our construction of the ADEA. In Price Waterhouse, a plurality of the Court and twoJustices concurring in the judgment determined that once a “plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff’s membership in a protected class] played a motivating partin an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor] into account.” 490\nU. S., at 258; see also id., at 259–260 (opinion of White,J.); id., at 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). But as we explained in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 94–95 (2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitlyauthorizing discrimination claims in which an improperconsideration was “a motivating factor” for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(m) (providing that “an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that \n—————— 1Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to include this threshold inquiry, “[t]he statement of any question presentedis deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.” This Court’s Rule 14.1; see also City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 544 U. S. 197, 214, n. 8 (2005) (“ ‘Questions not explicitly mentioned but essential to the analysis of the decisions below or to the correct disposition of the other issues have been treated as subsidiary issues fairly comprised by the question presented’ ” (quoting\nR. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 414 (8th ed. 2002))); Ballard v. Commissioner, 544 U. S. 40, 46–47, and \nn. 2 (2005) (evaluating “a question anterior” to the “questions the parties raised”). 6 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court \nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though otherfactors also motivated the practice” (emphasis added));§2000e–5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs proving violations of §2000e–2(m)). \nThis Court has never held that this burden-shiftingframework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we“must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA’s text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply amotivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to addsuch a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VIIto add §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), even though itcontemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil Rights Act of 1991, §115, 105 Stat. 1079; id., §302, at 1088.\nWe cannot ignore Congress’ decision to amend TitleVII’s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally. See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 \nU. S. 244, 256 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, “negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest” when the provisions were “considered simultaneously when the language raising theimplication was inserted.” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330 (1997). As a result, the Court’s interpretation ofthe ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as Desert Palace and Price Waterhouse.2 \n—————— 2 JUSTICE STEVENS argues that the Court must incorporate its past interpretations of Title VII into the ADEA because “the substantive Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) 7 \nOpinion of the Court \nB Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of theADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. “Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.” Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides, in relevant part, that “[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29 \nU. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nThe words “because of” mean “by reason of: on account of.” 1 Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933) \n—————— provisions of the ADEA were derived in haec verba from Title VII,” post, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), andbecause the Court has frequently applied its interpretations of Title VII to the ADEA, see post, at 4–6. But the Court’s approach to interpretingthe ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform. In General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 (2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase “because of . . . age” in 29 \nU. S. C. §623(a) to bar discrimination against people of all ages, eventhough the Court had previously interpreted “because of . . . race [or]sex” in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all races andboth sexes, see 540 U. S., at 584, 592, n. 5. And the Court has not definitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), utilized in Title VII casesis appropriate in the ADEA context. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 142 (2000); O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996). In this instance, it is the textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applying Price Waterhouse and Desert Palace to federal age discrimination claims. 8 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nOpinion of the Court \n(defining “because of” to mean “By reason of, on account of” (italics in original)); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining “because” tomean “by reason; on account”). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the ADEA’s requirement that an employer tookadverse action “because of” age is that age was the “reason” that the employer decided to act. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993) (explaining that the claim “cannot succeed unless the employee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer’s decisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome” (emphasis added)). To establish a disparatetreatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA,therefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse decision. See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)(slip op., at 14) (recognizing that the phrase, “by reasonof,” requires at least a showing of “but for” causation (internal quotation marks omitted)); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63–64, and n. 14 (2007) (observing that “[i]n common talk, the phrase ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition” and that the statutory phrase, “based on,” has the same meaning as the phrase, “because of” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D.Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984) (“An act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event would have occurred without it”).3 \n—————— 3 JUSTICE BREYER contends that there is “nothing unfair or impractical” about hinging liability on whether “forbidden motive . . . play[ed] arole in the employer’s decision.” Post, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion). But that is a decision for Congress to make. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18). Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer liability when discrimination “was a motivating factor for any employment practice, 9 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nOpinion of the Court \nIt follows, then, that under §623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse action. Indeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner in ADEA cases. See Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___–___ (2008) (slip op., at 2–4, 11–13); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 141, 143 (2000). And nothing in the statute’s text indicates that Congress has carvedout an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the statutory text is “silent on the allocation of theburden of persuasion,” we “begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005); see also Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, 554 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6) (“Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, . . . we willconclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief” (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule in this setting. \nHence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motivescases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the “but-for” cause of the challenged employer decision. See Reeves, supra, at 141–143, 147.4 \n—————— even though other factors also motivated the practice,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(m) (emphasis added), but did not similarly amend the ADEA, see supra, at 5–6. We must give effect to Congress’ choice. See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21). 4Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain the burden of persuasion to prove all disparate-treatment claims, we do not need to addresswhether plaintiffs must present direct, rather than circumstantial, evidence to obtain a burden-shifting instruction. There is no height10 \nGROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court III \nFinally, we reject petitioner’s contention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled by Price Waterhouse, which initially established that the burden of persuasionshifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.5 In anyevent, it is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today inthe first instance. Cf. 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21) (declining to “introduc[e] a qualification into the ADEA that is not found inits text”); Meacham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (explaining that the ADEA must be “read . . . the way Congress wrote it”). —————— ened evidentiary requirement for ADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their\nburden of persuasion that age was the “but-for” cause of their employer’s adverse action, see 29 U. S. C. §623(a), and we will imply none. “Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proofrequirements” in other statutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29, when it has seen fit. See Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 99 (2003); see also, e.g., 25 U. S. C. §2504(b)(2)(B) (imposing “clear and convincing evidence” standard); 29 U. S. C. §722(a)(2)(A) (same). \n5 JUSTICE STEVENS also contends that we must apply Price Waterhouse under the reasoning of Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228 (2005). See post, at 7. In Smith, the Court applied to the ADEA itspre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to disparate-impactclaims despite Congress’ 1991 amendment adding disparate-impactclaims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U. S., at 240. But the amendments made by Congress in this same legislation, which addedthe “motivating factor” language to Title VII, undermine JUSTICE STEVENS’ argument. Congress not only explicitly added “motivatingfactor” liability to Title VII, see supra, at 5–6, but it also partially abrogated Price Waterhouse’s holding by eliminating an employer’scomplete affirmative defense to “motivating factor” claims, see 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). If such “motivating factor” claims werealready part of Title VII, the addition of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B) alone wouldhave been sufficient. Congress’ careful tailoring of the “motivating factor” claim in Title VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to §2000e–2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that we cannot transfer the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework into the ADEA. 11 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nOpinion of the Court \nWhatever the deficiencies of Price Waterhouse in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts havefound it particularly difficult to craft an instruction toexplain its burden-shifting framework. See, e.g., Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 958 F. 2d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992) (referring to “the murky water of shifting burdens indiscrimination cases”); Visser v. Packer Engineering Associates, Inc., 924 F. 2d 655, 661 (CA7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (“The difficulty judges have informulating [burden-shifting] instructions and jurors havein applying them can be seen in the fact that jury verdictsin ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding the verdict or reversed on appeal more frequentlythan jury verdicts generally”). Thus, even if Price Waterhouse was doctrinally sound, the problems associated withits application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. Continental \nT. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47 (1977) (reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticismand “continuing controversy and confusion”); Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 839–844 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring).6 \n—————— 6Gross points out that the Court has also applied a burden-shiftingframework to certain claims brought in contexts other than pursuant toTitle VII. See Brief for Petitioner 54–55 (citing, inter alia, NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 401–403 (1983) (claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287 (1977) (constitutional claims)). These cases, however, do not require the Court to adopthis contra statutory position. The case involving the NLRA did notrequire the Court to decide in the first instance whether burden shifting should apply as the Court instead deferred to the National Labor Relation Board’s determination that such a framework was appropriate. See NLRB, supra, at 400–403. And the constitutional cases such as Mt. Healthy have no bearing on the correct interpretation of ADEA 12 \nGROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. Opinion of the Court IV \nWe hold that a plaintiff bringing a disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the “but-for” cause of the challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that itwould have taken the action regardless of age, even whena plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision. Accordingly, we vacatethe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the casefor further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nIt is so ordered. \n—————— claims, which are governed by statutory text. _________________ _________________ 1 Cite as: 557 U.

FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n[June 18, 2009] \nJUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting. \nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967(ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §621 et seq., makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee “because of” that individual’s age, §623(a). The most natural reading of this statutory text prohibits adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of theemployee. The “but-for” causation standard endorsed by the Court today was advanced in JUSTICE KENNEDY’s dissenting opinion in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 \nU. S. 228, 279 (1989), a case construing identical languagein Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.§2000e–2(a)(1). Not only did the Court reject the but-for standard in that case, but so too did Congress when itamended Title VII in 1991. Given this unambiguous history, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its own initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the causationrequirement in the ADEA that differs from the establishedreading of Title VII. I disagree not only with the Court’sinterpretation of the statute, but also with its decision toengage in unnecessary lawmaking. I would simply answerthe question presented by the certiorari petition and holdthat a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction. 2 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nSTEVENS, J., dissenting \nI The Court asks whether a mixed-motives instruction is ever appropriate in an ADEA case. As it acknowledges, this was not the question we granted certiorari to decide.1 Instead, the question arose for the first time in respondent’s brief, which asked us to “overrule Price Waterhouse with respect to its application to the ADEA.” Brief for Respondent 26 (boldface type deleted). In the usual course, this Court would not entertain such a requestraised only in a merits brief: “‘We would normally expect notice of an intent to make so far-reaching an argument inthe respondent’s opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf.this Court’s Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely affected and wishing to participate.’” Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 660, n. 3 (2002) (quoting South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999)). Yet the Court is unconcerned that the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed by the parties or interested amici curiae. Its failure to consider the views of the United States, which represents the agency charged with administering the ADEA, is especially irresponsible.2 Unfortunately, the majority’s inattention to prudentialCourt practices is matched by its utter disregard of ourprecedent and Congress’ intent. The ADEA provides that“[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his com—————— 1“The question presented by the petitioner in this case is whether aplaintiff must present direct evidence of age discrimination in order toobtain a mixed-motives jury instruction in a suit brought under the [ADEA].” Ante, at 1. 2The United States filed an amicus curiae brief supporting petitioner on the question presented. At oral argument, the Government urged that the Court should not reach the issue it takes up today. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20–21, 28–29. 3 Cite as: 557 U.

As we recognized in Price Waterhouse when we construed the identical “because of” language of Title VII, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) (making it unlawful for an employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to dischargeany individual . . . with respect to his compensation,terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin” (emphasis added)), the most natural reading of thetext proscribes adverse employment actions motivated inwhole or in part by the age of the employee. \nIn Price Waterhouse, we concluded that the words “‘because of’ such individual’s . . . sex . . . mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.” 490 U. S., at 240 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment). To establish a violation of Title VII, we therefore held, a plaintiff had to prove that her sex was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.3 We recognized that the employer had an affirmativedefense: It could avoid a finding of liability by proving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff’s sex into account. Id., at 244–245 (plurality opinion). But this affirmative defense did not alter the meaning of “because of.” As we made clear, when “an employer considers both gender and legitimate factorsat the time of making a decision, that decision was ‘be—————— \n3Although Justice White stated that the plaintiff had to show thather sex was a “substantial” factor, while the plurality used the term“motivating” factor, these standards are interchangeable, as evidencedby Justice White’s quotation of Mt.

S. 274, 287 (1977): “ ‘[T]he burden was properly placed upon [theplaintiff to show that the illegitimate criterion] was a “substantialfactor”—or, to put it in other words, that it was a “motivating factor” ’ ” in the adverse decision.

We readily rejected the dissent’s contrary assertion. “To construe the words ‘because of’ as colloquial shorthand for ‘but-for’ causation,” we said, “is tomisunderstand them.” Id., at 240 (plurality opinion).4 \nToday, however, the Court interprets the words “because of” in the ADEA “as colloquial shorthand for ‘but-for’ causation.” Ibid. That the Court is construing the ADEArather than Title VII does not justify this departure fromprecedent. The relevant language in the two statutes is identical, and we have long recognized that our interpretations of Title VII’s language apply “with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA ‘were derived in haec verba from Title VII.’” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)). See generally Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per curiam). For this reason, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s dissent in Price Waterhouse assumed the plurality’s mixed-motivesframework extended to the ADEA, see 490 U. S., at 292, and the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issueunanimously have applied Price Waterhouse to ADEA claims.5 \n—————— 4We were no doubt aware that dictionaries define “because of” as “byreason of” or “on account of.” Ante, at 7–8. Contrary to the majority’s bald assertion, however, this does not establish that the term denotes but-for causation. The dictionaries the Court cites do not, for instance, define “because of” as “solely by reason of” or “exclusively on account of.” In Price Waterhouse, we recognized that the words “because of” do not mean “solely because of,” and we held that the inquiry “commanded by the words” of the statute was whether gender was a motivating factorin the employment decision. 490 U. S., at 241 (plurality opinion). 5See Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214 F. 3d 57 (CA1 2000); Ostrowski v. Atlantic Mut. Ins. Cos., 968 F. 2d 171 (CA2 1992); Starceski v. Westinghouse Elec.

S. ____ (2009) STEVENS, J., dissenting \nThe Court nonetheless suggests that applying Price Waterhouse would be inconsistent with our ADEA precedents. In particular, the Court relies on our statement in Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993), that “[a disparate-treatment] claim ‘cannot succeed unless the employee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the employer’s decisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome.’” Ante, at 8. The italicized phrase is at best inconclusive as to the meaning of theADEA’s “because of” language, however, as other passagesin Hazen Paper Co. demonstrate. We also stated, for instance, that the ADEA “requires the employer to ignorean employee’s age,” id., at 612 (emphasis added), and noted that “[w]hen the employer’s decision is wholly motivated by factors other than age,” there is no violation, id., at 611 (emphasis altered). So too, we indicated the “possibility of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where the decision to fire the employee was motivated both bythe employee’s age and by his pension status,” id., at 613—a classic mixed-motives scenario. \nMoreover, both Hazen Paper Co. and Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133 (2000), onwhich the majority also relies, support the conclusion thatthe ADEA should be interpreted consistently with Title\nVII. In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court followed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives Title VII cases including McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 (1981). See, e.g., Reeves, 530 U. S., at 141–143; Hazen Paper Co., 507 U. S., \n—————— In The Box, Inc., 376 F. 3d 305 (CA5 2004); Wexler v. White’s Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F. 3d 564 (CA6 2003); Visser v. Packer Eng.

This by no means indicates, as the majority reasons, that mixed-motives ADEA cases should follow those standards. Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards are generally understood to conform to Title VII standards. \nII The conclusion that “because of” an individual’s agemeans that age was a motivating factor in an employment decision is bolstered by Congress’ reaction to Price Waterhouse in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As part of its response to “a number of recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil rights] laws,” H. R. Rep. No. 102–40, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), Congress eliminated the affirmative defense to liability that Price Waterhouse had furnished employers and provided instead that an employer’s same-decision showing would limit only a plaintiff’s remedies. See §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). Importantly,however, Congress ratified Price Waterhouse’s interpretation of the plaintiff’s burden of proof, rejecting the dissent’s suggestion in that case that but-for causation was the proper standard. See §2000e–2(m) (“[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employmentpractice, even though other factors also motivated the practice”).Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not the ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Courtreasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to the ADEA.6 But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion com\n—————— 6There is, however, some evidence that Congress intended the 1991mixed-motives amendments to apply to the ADEA as well. See H. R. Rep., pt. 2, at 4 (noting that a “number of other laws banning discrimination, including . . . the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §621, et seq., are modeled after and have been 7 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nSTEVENS, J., dissenting \npelled by this interpretation of the Act: Price Waterhouse’s construction of “because of” remains the governing law for ADEA claims. \nOur recent decision in Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 \nU. S. 228, 240 (2005), is precisely on point, as we considered in that case the effect of Congress’ failure to amend the disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it amended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the 1991 Act. Noting that “the relevant 1991 amendmentsexpanded the coverage of Title VII [but] did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,” we held that “Wards Cove’s pre-1991 interpretation of TitleVII’s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.” 544 U. S., at 240 (discussing Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989)); see also Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 15). If the Wards Cove disparate-impact frameworkthat Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII contextcontinues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives framework that Congress substantially endorsed surely applies.\nCuriously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying on Congress’ partial ratification of Price Waterhouse to argue against that case’s precedential value. It reasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the ADEA, Price Waterhouse likewise must not apply becauseCongress effectively codified Price Waterhouse’s holding inthe amendments. Ante, at 5–6. This does not follow. To the contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court’s interpretation of the “because of” language in Price Waterhouse (even as it rejected the employer’s affirmative de\n—————— interpreted in a manner consistent with Title VII,” and that “theseother laws modeled after Title VII [should] be interpreted consistentlyin a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act,” including the mixed-motives provisions). 8 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nSTEVENS, J., dissenting \nfense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere tothat decision’s motivating-factor test. Indeed, Congressemphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivatingfactor test was consistent with its original intent in enacting Title VII. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., pt. 2, at 17 (“Whenenacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clearthat it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employmentdecisions”); id., at 2 (stating that the Act “reaffirm[ed] thatany reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions is illegal”); see also H. R. Rep., pt. 1, at 45; S. Rep. No. 101–315, pp. 6, 22 (1990).\nThe 1991 amendments to Title VII also provide theanswer to the majority’s argument that the mixed-motivesapproach has proved unworkable. Ante, at 10–11. Because Congress has codified a mixed-motives frameworkfor Title VII cases—the vast majority of antidiscrimination lawsuits—the Court’s concerns about that framework are of no moment. Were the Court truly worried about difficulties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would not reach today’s decision, which will further complicate every case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title VII claims. \nThe Court’s resurrection of the but-for causation standard is unwarranted. Price Waterhouse repudiated that standard 20 years ago, and Congress’ response to our decision further militates against the crabbed interpretation the Court adopts today. The answer to the questionthe Court has elected to take up—whether a mixedmotives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case—is plainly yes. \nIII Although the Court declines to address the question wegranted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question by following our unanimous opinion in Desert Palace, Inc. Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) 9 \nSTEVENS, J., dissenting \nv. Costa, 539 U. S. 90 (2003). I would accordingly holdthat a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction. \nThe source of the direct-evidence debate is Justice O’Connor’s opinion concurring in the judgment in Price Waterhouse. Writing only for herself, Justice O’Connorargued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce“direct evidence” that her sex motivated the decision before the plurality’s mixed-motives framework wouldapply. 490 U. S., at 276.7 Many courts have treated Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Price Waterhouse as controlling for both Title VII and ADEA mixed-motives cases in lightof our statement in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), that “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides acase and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’ ” Unlike the cases Marks addressed, however, Price Waterhouse garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice White agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor test, see supra, at 3, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type of evidence an employer was required to submit to prove that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. Taking the plurality to demandobjective evidence, he wrote separately to express his viewthat an employer’s credible testimony could suffice. 490 \nU. S., at 261. Because Justice White provided a fifth votefor the “rationale explaining the result” of the Price Waterhouse decision, Marks, 430 U. S., at 193, his concur\n—————— 7While Justice O’Connor did not define precisely what she meant by “direct evidence,” we contrasted such evidence with circumstantial evidence in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90 (2003). That Justice O’Connor might have intended a different definition does not affect my conclusion, as I do not believe a plaintiff is required to introduce any special type of evidence to obtain a mixed-motives instruction. 10 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nSTEVENS, J., dissenting \nrence is properly understood as controlling, and he, likethe plurality, did not require the introduction of direct evidence. \nAny questions raised by Price Waterhouse as to a direct evidence requirement were settled by this Court’s unanimous decision in Desert Palace, in which we held that a plaintiff need not introduce direct evidence to meet her burden in a mixed-motives case under Title VII, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In construingthe language of §2000e–2(m), we reasoned that the statutedid not mention, much less require, a heightened showingthrough direct evidence and that “Congress has beenunequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements.” 539 U. S., at 99. The statute’s silence with respect to direct evidence, we held, meant that “we shouldnot depart from the ‘[c]onventional rul[e] of civil litigation . . . [that] requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence’, . . . using ‘direct or circumstantial evidence.’” Ibid. (quoting Price Waterhouse, 490 \nU. S., at 253 (plurality opinion), and Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711 (1983)). We also recognized the Court’s consistent acknowledgment of the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases. \nOur analysis in Desert Palace applies with equal force tothe ADEA. Cf. ante, at 9–10, n. 4. As with the 1991 amendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA imposes a heightened direct evidence requirement, and we have specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial evidence in ADEA cases. See Reeves, 530 U. S., at 147 (cited by Desert Palace, 539 U. S., at 99–100). Moreover, in Hazen Paper Co., we held that an award of liquidated damages for a “willful” violation of the ADEA did not require proof of the employer’s motivation through directevidence, 507 U. S., at 615, and we have similarly rejected the imposition of special evidentiary rules in other ADEA cases. See, e.g., Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S. 11 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) STEVENS, J., dissenting \n506 (2002); O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308 (1996). Desert Palace thus confirms the answer provided by the plurality and Justice White in Price Waterhouse: An ADEA plaintiff need not present direct evidence of discrimination to obtain a mixedmotives instruction. \nIV The Court’s endorsement of a different construction of the same critical language in the ADEA and Title VII is both unwise and inconsistent with settled law. The butfor standard the Court adopts was rejected by this Court in Price Waterhouse and by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Yet today the Court resurrects the standard in an unabashed display of judicial lawmaking. I respectfully dissent. _________________ _________________ 1 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nBREYER, J., dissenting \n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nNo. 08–441 \nJACK GROSS, PETITIONER v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n[June 18, 2009] \nJUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting. \nI agree with JUSTICE STEVENS that mixed-motive instructions are appropriate in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act context. And I join his opinion. The Court rejects this conclusion on the ground that the words “because of” require a plaintiff to prove that age was the “but-for” cause of his employer’s adverse employment action. Ante, at 7. But the majority does not explain why this is so. The words “because of” do not inherently require a showing of “but-for” causation, and I see no reason to read them to require such a showing.\nIt is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show“but-for” causation. In that context, reasonably objective scientific or commonsense theories of physical causation make the concept of “but-for” causation comparativelyeasy to understand and relatively easy to apply. But it is an entirely different matter to determine a “but-for” relation when we consider, not physical forces, but the mindrelated characterizations that constitute motive. Sometimes we speak of determining or discovering motives, but more often we ascribe motives, after an event, to an individual in light of the individual’s thoughts and other circumstances present at the time of decision. In a case where we characterize an employer’s actions as having 2 GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nbeen taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the employee was old and because he wore loud clothing, toapply “but-for” causation is to engage in a hypotheticalinquiry about what would have happened if the employer’sthoughts and other circumstances had been different. The answer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from obvious, and, since the employee likely knows less thandoes the employer about what the employer was thinking at the time, the employer will often be in a stronger position than the employee to provide the answer. \nAll that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a context is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the employer’s decision. And the fact that a jury has found that age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of the word “because,” i.e., the employer dismissed the employee because of his age (and other things). See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 239–242 (1989) (plurality opinion). I therefore would see nothing wrong inconcluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of the statute. \nBut the law need not automatically assess liability in these circumstances. In Price Waterhouse, the plurality recognized an affirmative defense where the defendantcould show that the employee would have been dismissed regardless. The law permits the employer this defense,not because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the actual decision, but because the employer can show that he would have dismissed the employee anyway in the hypothetical circumstance in which his age-related motive was absent. And it makes sense that this would be an affirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a violation, precisely because the defendant is in a better position than the plaintiff to establish how he would haveacted in this hypothetical situation. See id., at 242; cf. ante, at 6 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing the Title VII framework). I can see nothing unfair or impractical 3 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009) \nBREYER, J., dissenting \nabout allocating the burdens of proof in this way. \nThe instruction that the District Court gave seems appropriate and lawful. It says, in pertinent part: \n“Your verdict must be for plaintiff if all the follow\ning elements have been proved by the preponderance \nof the evidence: \n. . . . . “[The] plaintiff’s age was a motivating factor in defendant’s decision to demote plaintiff. “However, your verdict must be for defendant . . . if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff regardless of his age. . . . . . “As used in these instructions, plaintiff’s age was ‘a motivating factor,’ if plaintiff’s age played a part or a role in the defendant’s decision to demote plaintiff. However, plaintiff’s age need not have been the only reason for defendant’s decision to demote plaintiff.”App. 9–10. \nFor these reasons as well as for those set forth by JUSTICE STEVENS, I respectfully dissent.\n",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CITY\nOF BOCA RATON\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT</center>\n\n\n[June 26, 1998]\nJustice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis case calls for identification of the circumstances under which an employer may be held liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., for the acts of a supervisory employee whose sexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work environment amounting to employment discrimination. We hold that an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer’s conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.\nI\nBetween 1985 and 1990, while attending college, petitioner Beth Ann Faragher worked part time and during the summers as an ocean lifeguard for the Marine Safety Section of the Parks and Recreation Department of respondent, the City of Boca Raton, Florida (City). During this period, Faragher’s immediate supervisors were Bill Terry, David Silverman, and Robert Gordon. In June 1990, Faragher resigned.\nIn 1992, Faragher brought an action against Terry, Silverman, and the City, asserting claims under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Florida law. So far as it concerns the Title VII claim, the complaint alleged that Terry and Silverman created a “sexually hostile atmosphere” at the beach by repeatedly subjecting Faragher and other female lifeguards to “uninvited and offensive touching,” by making lewd remarks, and by speaking of women in offensive terms. The complaint contained specific allegations that Terry once said that he would never promote a woman to the rank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had said to Faragher, “Date me or clean the toilets for a year.” Asserting that Terry and Silverman were agents of the City, and that their conduct amounted to discrimination in the “terms, conditions, and privileges” of her employment, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e—2(a)(1), Faragher sought a judgment against the City for nominal damages, costs, and attorney’s fees.\nFollowing a bench trial, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida found that throughout Faragher’s employment with the City, Terry served as Chief of the Marine Safety Division, with authority to hire new lifeguards (subject to the approval of higher management), to supervise all aspects of the lifeguards’ work assignments, to engage in counseling, to deliver oral reprimands, and to make a record of any such discipline. 864 F. Supp. 1552, 1563—1564 (1994). Silverman was a Marine Safety lieutenant from 1985 until June 1989, when he became a captain. Id., at 1555. Gordon began the employment period as a lieutenant and at some point was promoted to the position of training captain. In these positions, Silverman and Gordon were responsible for making the lifeguards’ daily assignments, and for supervising their work and fitness training.Id., at 1564.\nThe lifeguards and supervisors were stationed at the city beach and worked out of the Marine Safety Headquarters, a small one-story building containing an office, a meeting room, and a single, unisex locker room with a shower. Id., at 1556. Their work routine was structured in a “paramilitary configuration,” id., at 1564, with a clear chain of command. Lifeguards reported to lieutenants and captains, who reported to Terry. He was supervised by the Recreation Superintendent, who in turn reported to a Director of Parks and Recreation, answerable to the City Manager. Id., at 1555. The lifeguards had no significant contact with higher city officials like the Recreation Superintendent. Id., at 1564.\nIn February 1986, the City adopted a sexual harassment policy, which it stated in a memorandum from the City Manager addressed to all employees. Id., at 1560. In May 1990, the City revised the policy and reissued a statement of it. Ibid. Although the City may actually have circulated the memos and statements to some employees, it completely failed to disseminate its policy among employees of the Marine Safety Section, with the result that Terry, Silverman, Gordon, and many lifeguards were unaware of it. Ibid.\nFrom time to time over the course of Faragher’s tenure at the Marine Safety Section, between 4 and 6 of the 40 to 50 lifeguards were women. Id., at 1556. During that 5-year period, Terry repeatedly touched the bodies of female employees without invitation, ibid., would put his arm around Faragher, with his hand on her buttocks, id., at 1557, and once made contact with another female lifeguard in a motion of sexual simulation, id., at 1556. He made crudely demeaning references to women generally, id., at 1557, and once commented disparagingly on Faragher’s shape,ibid. During a job interview with a woman he hired as a lifeguard, Terry said that the female lifeguards had sex with their male counterparts and asked whether she would do the same. Ibid.\nSilverman behaved in similar ways. He once tackled Faragher and remarked that, but for a physical characteristic he found unattractive, he would readily have had sexual relations with her.Ibid. Another time, he pantomimed an act of oral sex. Ibid. Within earshot of the female lifeguards, Silverman made frequent, vulgar references to women and sexual matters, commented on the bodies of female lifeguards and beachgoers, and at least twice told female lifeguards that he would like to engage in sex with them. Id., at 1557—1558.\nFaragher did not complain to higher management about Terry or Silverman. Although she spoke of their behavior to Gordon, she did not regard these discussions as formal complaints to a supervisor but as conversations with a person she held in high esteem. Id., at 1559. Other female lifeguards had similarly informal talks with Gordon, but because Gordon did not feel that it was his place to do so, he did not report these complaints to Terry, his own supervisor, or to any other city official. Id., at 1559—1560. Gordon responded to the complaints of one lifeguard by saying that “the City just [doesn’t] care.” Id., at 1561.\nIn April 1990, however, two months before Faragher’s resignation, Nancy Ewanchew, a former lifeguard, wrote to Richard Bender, the City’s Personnel Director, complaining that Terry and Silverman had harassed her and other female lifeguards. Id., at 1559. Following investigation of this complaint, the City found that Terry and Silverman had behaved improperly, reprimanded them, and required them to choose between a suspension without pay or the forfeiture of annual leave. Ibid.\nOn the basis of these findings, the District Court concluded that the conduct of Terry and Silverman was discriminatory harassment sufficiently serious to alter the conditions of Faragher’s employment and constitute an abusive working environment. Id., at 1562—1563. The District Court then ruled that there were three justifications for holding the City liable for the harassment of its supervisory employees. First, the court noted that the harassment was pervasive enough to support an inference that the City had “knowledge, or constructive knowledge” of it. Id., at 1563. Next, it ruled that the City was liable under traditional agency principles because Terry and Silverman were acting as its agents when they committed the harassing acts. Id., at 1563—1564. Finally, the court observed that Gordon’s knowledge of the harassment, combined with his inaction, “provides a further basis for imputing liability on [sic] the City.” Id., at 1564. The District Court then awarded Faragher one dollar in nominal damages on her Title VII claim. Id., at 1564—1565.\nA panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the judgment against the City. 76 F.3d 1155 (1996). Although the panel had “no trouble concluding that Terry’s and Silverman’s conduct … was severe and pervasive enough to create an objectively abusive work environment,” id., at 1162, it overturned the District Court’s conclusion that the City was liable. The panel ruled that Terry and Silverman were not acting within the scope of their employment when they engaged in the harassment, id., at 1166, that they were not aided in their actions by the agency relationship, id., at 1166, n. 14, and that the City had no constructive knowledge of the harassment by virtue of its pervasiveness or Gordon’s actual knowledge, id., at 1167, and n. 16.\nIn a 7-to-5 decision, the full Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, adopted the panel’s conclusion. 111 F.3d 1530 (1997). Relying on our decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57(1986), and on the Restatement (Second) of Agency §219 (1957) (hereafter Restatement), the court held that “an employer may be indirectly liable for hostile environment sexual harassment by a superior: (1) if the harassment occurs within the scope of the superior’s employment; (2) if the employer assigns performance of a nondelegable duty to a supervisor and an employee is injured because of the supervisor’s failure to carry out that duty; or (3) if there is an agency relationship which aids the supervisor’s ability or opportunity to harass his subordinate.” Id., at 1534—1535.\nApplying these principles, the court rejected Faragher’s Title VII claim against the City. First, invoking standard agency language to classify the harassment by each supervisor as a “frolic” unrelated to his authorized tasks, the court found that in harassing Faragher, Terry and Silverman were acting outside of the scope of their employment and solely to further their own personal ends.Id., at 1536—1537. Next, the court determined that the supervisors’ agency relationship with the City did not assist them in perpetrating their harassment. Id., at 1537. Though noting that “a supervisor is always aided in accomplishing hostile environment sexual harassment by the existence of the agency relationship with his employer because his responsibilities include close proximity to and regular contact with the victim,” the court held that traditional agency law does not employ so broad a concept of aid as a predicate of employer liability, but requires something more than a mere combination of agency relationship and improper conduct by the agent. Ibid. Because neither Terry nor Silverman threatened to fire or demote Faragher, the court concluded that their agency relationship did not facilitate their harassment. Ibid.\nThe en banc court also affirmed the panel’s ruling that the City lacked constructive knowledge of the supervisors’ harassment. The court read the District Court’s opinion to rest on an erroneous legal conclusion that any harassment pervasive enough to create a hostile environment must a fortiori also suffice to charge the employer with constructive knowledge. Id., at 1538. Rejecting this approach, the court reviewed the record and found no adequate factual basis to conclude that the harassment was so pervasive that the City should have known of it, relying on the facts that the harassment occurred intermittently, over a long period of time, and at a remote location. Ibid. In footnotes, the court also rejected the arguments that the City should be deemed to have known of the harassment through Gordon, id., at 1538, n. 9, or charged with constructive knowledge because of its failure to disseminate its sexual harassment policy among the lifeguards,id., at 1539, n. 11.\nSince our decision in Meritor, Courts of Appeals have struggled to derive manageable standards to govern employer liability for hostile environment harassment perpetrated by supervisory employees. While following our admonition to find guidance in the common law of agency, as embodied in the Restatement, the Courts of Appeals have adopted different approaches. Compare,e.g., Harrison v. Eddy Potash, Inc., 112 F.3d 1437 (CA10 1997), cert. pending, No. 97—232; 111 F.3d 1530 (CA11 1997) (case below); Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d 1391 (CADC), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1011 (1995); and Karibian v. Columbia University, 14 F.3d 773 (CA2), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1213 (1994). We granted certiorari to address the divergence, 522 U.S. ___ (1997), and now reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and remand for entry of judgment in Faragher’s favor.\nII\nA\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, “[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e—2(a)(1). We have repeatedly made clear that although the statute mentions specific employment decisions with immediate consequences, the scope of the prohibition “ ‘is not limited to “economic” or “tangible” discrimination,’ ” Harris v.Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S., at 64), and that it covers more than “ ‘terms’ and ‘conditions’ in the narrow contractual sense.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. ___, ___ (1998) (slip op., at 2—3). Thus, in Meritor we held that sexual harassment so “severe or pervasive” as to “ ‘alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment’ ” violates Title VII. 477 U.S., at 67 (quoting Hensonv. Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (CA11 1982)).\nIn thus holding that environmental claims are covered by the statute, we drew upon earlier cases recognizing liability for discriminatory harassment based on race and national origin, see,e.g., Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 957 (1972); Firefighters Institute for Racial Equality v. St. Louis, 549 F.2d 506 (CA8), cert. denied sub nom. Banta v. United States, 434 U.S. 819 (1977), just as we have also followed the lead of such cases in attempting to define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to constitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute. See, e.g., Rogers, supra, at 238 (“[M]ere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee” would not sufficiently alter terms and conditions of employment to violate Title VII).1 See also Daniels v.Essex Group, Inc., 937 F.2d 1264, 1271—1272 (CA7 1991); Davis v.Monsanto Chemical Co., 858 F.2d 345, 349 (CA6 1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1110 (1989); Snell v. Suffolk County, 782 F.2d 1094, 1103 (CA2 1986); 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 349, and nn. 36—37 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann & Grossman) (citing cases instructing that “[d]iscourtesy or rudeness should not be confused with racial harassment” and that “a lack of racial sensitivity does not, alone, amount to actionable harassment”).\nSo, in Harris, we explained that in order to be actionable under the statute, a sexually objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be so. 510 U.S., at 21—22. We directed courts to determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by “looking at all the circumstances,” including the “frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.” Id., at 23. Most recently, we explained that Title VII does not prohibit “genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex.” Oncale, 523 U.S., at ____ (slip op., at 6). A recurring point in these opinions is that “simple teasing,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 7), offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the “terms and conditions of employment.”\nThese standards for judging hostility are sufficiently demanding to ensure that Title VII does not become a “general civility code.”Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6). Properly applied, they will filter out complaints attacking “the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional teasing.” B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Sexual Harassment in Employment Law 175 (1992) (hereinafter Lindemann & Kadue) (footnotes omitted). We have made it clear that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, and the Courts of Appeals have heeded this view. See, e.g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F.2d 569, 577—578 (CA2 1989); Moylan v. Maries County, 792 F.2d 746, 749—750 (CA8 1986); See also 1 Lindemann & Grossman 805—807, n. 290 (collecting cases granting summary judgment for employers because the alleged harassment was not actionably severe or pervasive).\nWhile indicating the substantive contours of the hostile environments forbidden by Title VII, our cases have established few definite rules for determining when an employer will be liable for a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive. Given the circumstances of many of the litigated cases, including some that have come to us, it is not surprising that in many of them, the issue has been joined over the sufficiency of the abusive conditions, not the standards for determining an employer’s liability for them. There have, for example, been myriad cases in which District Courts and Courts of Appeals have held employers liable on account of actual knowledge by the employer, or high-echelon officials of an employer organization, of sufficiently harassing action by subordinates, which the employer or its informed officers have done nothing to stop. See, e.g., Katzv. Dole, 709 F.2d 251, 256 (CA4 1983) (upholding employer liability because the “employer’s supervisory personnel manifested unmistakable acquiescence in or approval of the harassment”);EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel, 881 F.2d 1504, 1516 (CA9 1989) (employer liable where hotel manager did not respond to complaints about supervisors’ harassment); Hall v. Gus Constr. Co., 842 F.2d 1010, 1016 (CA8 1988) (holding employer liable for harassment by co-workers because supervisor knew of the harassment but did nothing). In such instances, the combined knowledge and inaction may be seen as demonstrable negligence, or as the employer’s adoption of the offending conduct and its results, quite as if they had been authorized affirmatively as the employer’s policy. Cf. Oncale, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2) (victim reported his grounds for fearing rape to company’s safety supervisor, who turned him away with no action on complaint).\nNor was it exceptional that standards for binding the employer were not in issue in Harris, supra. In that case of discrimination by hostile environment, the individual charged with creating the abusive atmosphere was the president of the corporate employer, 510 U.S., at 19, who was indisputably within that class of an employer organization’s officials who may be treated as the organization’s proxy. Burns v. McGregor Electronic Industries, Inc., 955 F.2d 559, 564 (CA8 1992) (employer-company liable where harassment was perpetrated by its owner); see Torres v.Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 634—635, and n. 11 (CA2) (noting that a supervisor may hold a sufficiently high position “in the management hierarchy of the company for his actions to be imputed automatically to the employer”), cert. denied, 522 U.S. ___ (1997); cf. Katz, supra, at 255 (“Except in situations where a proprietor, partner or corporate officer participates personally in the harassing behavior,” an employee must “demonstrat[e] the propriety of holding the employer liable”).\nFinally, there is nothing remarkable in the fact that claims against employers for discriminatory employment actions with tangible results, like hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and work assignment, have resulted in employer liability once the discrimination was shown. See Meritor, 477 U.S., at 70—71 (noting that “courts have consistently held employers liable for the discriminatory discharges of employees by supervisory personnel, whether or not the employer knew, should have known, or approved of the supervisor’s actions”); id., at 75 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) (“[W]hen a supervisor discriminatorily fires or refuses to promote a black employee, that act is, without more, considered the act of the employer”); see also Anderson v. Methodist Evangelical Hospital, Inc., 464 F.2d 723, 725 (CA6 1972) (imposing liability on employer for racially motivated discharge by low-level supervisor, although the “record clearly shows that [its] record in race relations…is exemplary”).\nA variety of reasons have been invoked for this apparently unanimous rule. Some courts explain, in a variation of the “proxy” theory discussed above, that when a supervisor makes such decisions, he “merges” with the employer, and his act becomes that of the employer. See, e.g., Kotcher v. Rosa and Sullivan Appliance Ctr., Inc., 957 F.2d 59, 62 (CA2 1992) (“The supervisor is deemed to act on behalf of the employer when making decisions that affect the economic status of the employee. From the perspective of the employee, the supervisor and the employer merge into a single entity”); Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (CA11 1989) (“When a supervisor requires sexual favors as a quid pro quo for job benefits, the supervisor, by definition, acts as the company”); see also Lindemann & Grossman 776 (noting that courts hold employers “automatically liable” inquid pro quo cases because the “supervisor’s actions, in conferring or withholding employment benefits, are deemed as a matter of law to be those of the employer”). Other courts have suggested that vicarious liability is proper because the supervisor acts within the scope of his authority when he makes discriminatory decisions in hiring, firing, promotion, and the like. See, e.g., Shager v. Upjohn Co., 913 F.2d 398, 405 (CA7 1990) (“[A] supervisory employee who fires a subordinate is doing the kind of thing that he is authorized to do, and the wrongful intent with which he does it does not carry his behavior so far beyond the orbit of his responsibilities as to excuse the employer”) (citing Restatement §228). Others have suggested that vicarious liability is appropriate because the supervisor who discriminates in this manner is aided by the agency relation. See, e.g., Nichols v.Frank, 42 F.3d 503, 514 (CA9 1994). Finally, still other courts have endorsed both of the latter two theories. See, e.g., Harrison, 112 F.3d, at 1443; Henson, 682, F.2d, at 910.\nThe soundness of the results in these cases (and their continuing vitality), in light of basic agency principles, was confirmed by this Court’s only discussion to date of standards of employer liability, in Meritor, supra, which involved a claim of discrimination by a supervisor’s sexual harassment of a subordinate over an extended period. In affirming the Court of Appeals’s holding that a hostile atmosphere resulting from sex discrimination is actionable under Title VII, we also anticipated proceedings on remand by holding agency principles relevant in assigning employer liability and by rejecting three per se rules of liability or immunity. 477 U.S., at 70—72. We observed that the very definition of employer in Title VII, as including an “agent,” id., at 72, expressed Congress’s intent that courts look to traditional principles of the law of agency in devising standards of employer liability in those instances where liability for the actions of a supervisory employee was not otherwise obvious, ibid., and although we cautioned that “common-law principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII,” we cited the Restatement §§219—237, with general approval. Ibid.\nWe then proceeded to reject two limitations on employer liability, while establishing the rule that some limitation was intended. We held that neither the existence of a company grievance procedure nor the absence of actual notice of the harassment on the part of upper management would be dispositive of such a claim; while either might be relevant to the liability, neither would result automatically in employer immunity. Ibid. Conversely, we held that Title VII placed some limit on employer responsibility for the creation of a discriminatory environment by a supervisor, and we held that Title VII does not make employers “always automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors,” ibid., contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, which had held that “an employer is strictly liable for a hostile environment created by a supervisor’s sexual advances, even though the employer neither knew nor reasonably could have known of the alleged misconduct,” id., at 69—70.\nMeritor’s statement of the law is the foundation on which we build today. Neither party before us has urged us to depart from our customary adherence to stare decisis in statutory interpretation,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 172—173 (1989) (stare decisis has “special force” in statutory interpretation). And the force of precedent here is enhanced by Congress’s amendment to the liability provisions of Title VII since the Meritor decision, without providing any modification of our holding. Civil Rights Act of 1991, §102, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a; see Keene Corp.v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 212 (1993) (applying the “presumption that Congress was aware of [prior] judicial interpretations and, in effect, adopted them”). See also infra, at 26, n. 4.\nB\nThe Court of Appeals identified, and rejected, three possible grounds drawn from agency law for holding the City vicariously liable for the hostile environment created by the supervisors. It considered whether the two supervisors were acting within the scope of their employment when they engaged in the harassing conduct. The court then enquired whether they were significantly aided by the agency relationship in committing the harassment, and also considered the possibility of imputing Gordon’s knowledge of the harassment to the City. Finally, the Court of Appeals ruled out liability for negligence in failing to prevent the harassment. Faragher relies principally on the latter three theories of liability.\n1\nA “master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment.” Restatement §219(1). This doctrine has traditionally defined the “scope of employment” as including conduct “of the kind [a servant] is employed to perform,” occurring “substantially within the authorized time and space limits,” and “actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master,” but as excluding an intentional use of force “unexpectable by the master.” Id.,§228(1).\nCourts of Appeals have typically held, or assumed, that conduct similar to the subject of this complaint falls outside the scope of employment. See, e.g., Harrison, 112 F.3d, at 1444 (sexual harassment “ ‘simply is not within the job description of any supervisor or any other worker in any reputable business’ ”); 111 F.3d, at 1535—1536 (case below); Andrade v. Mayfair Management, Inc., 88 F.3d 258, 261 (CA4 1996) (“[I]llegal sexual harassment is … beyond the scope of supervisors’ employment”);Gary, 59 F.3d, at 1397 (harassing supervisor acts outside the scope of his employment in creating hostile environment); Nicholsv. Frank, 42 F.3d 503, 508 (CA9 1994) (“The proper analysis for employer liability in hostile environment cases is … not whether an employee was acting within his ‘scope of employment’ ”);Bouton v. BMW of North Am., Inc., 29 F.3d 103, 107 (CA3 1994) (sexual harassment is outside scope of employment); see alsoEllerth v. Burlington Industries, Inc., decided with Jansen v.Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F.3d 490, 561 (CA7 1997) (en banc) (Manion, J., concurring and dissenting) (supervisor’s harassment would fall within scope of employment only in “the rare case indeed”), cert. granted, No. 97—569; Lindemann & Grossman 812 (“Hostile environment sexual harassment normally does not trigger respondeat superior liability because sexual harassment rarely, if ever, is among the official duties of a supervisor”). But cf. Martin v. Cavalier Hotel Corp., 48 F.3d 1343, 1351—1352 (CA4 1995) (holding employer vicariously liable in part based on finding that the supervisor’s rape of employee was within the scope of employment); Kauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970 F.2d 178, 184 (CA6) (holding that a supervisor’s harassment was within the scope of his employment, but nevertheless requiring the victim to show that the employer failed to respond adequately when it learned of the harassment), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1041 (1992). In so doing, the courts have emphasized that harassment consisting of unwelcome remarks and touching is motivated solely by individual desires and serves no purpose of the employer. For this reason, courts have likened hostile environment sexual harassment to the classic “frolic and detour” for which an employer has no vicarious liability.\nThese cases ostensibly stand in some tension with others arising outside Title VII, where the scope of employment has been defined broadly enough to hold employers vicariously liable for intentional torts that were in no sense inspired by any purpose to serve the employer. In Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F.2d 167 (1968), for example, the Second Circuit charged the Government with vicarious liability for the depredation of a drunken sailor returning to his ship after a night’s carouse, who inexplicably opened valves that flooded a drydock, damaging both the drydock and the ship. Judge Friendly acknowledged that the sailor’s conduct was not remotely motivated by a purpose to serve his employer, but relied on the “deeply rooted sentiment that a business enterprise cannot justly disclaim responsibility for accidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of its activities,” and imposed vicarious liability on the ground that the sailor’s conduct “was not so ‘unforeseeable’ as to make it unfair to charge the Government with responsibility.” Id., at 171. Other examples of an expansive sense of scope of employment are readily found, see, e.g., Leonbruno v. Champlain Silk Mills, 229 N. Y. 470, 128 N. E. 711 (1920) (opinion of Cardozo, J.) (employer was liable under worker’s compensation statute for eye injury sustained when employee threw an apple at another; the accident arose “in the course of employment” because such horseplay should be expected); Carr v. Wm. C. Crowell Co., 28 Cal. 2d 652, 171 P.2d 5 (1946) (employer liable for actions of carpenter who attacked a co-employee with a hammer). Courts, in fact, have treated scope of employment generously enough to include sexual assaults. See, e.g., Primeaux v. United States, 102 F.3d 1458, 1462—1463 (CA8 1996) (federal police officer on limited duty sexually assaulted stranded motorist); Mary M. v. Los Angeles, 54 Cal. 3d 202, 216—221, 814 P.2d 1341, 1349—1352 (1991) (en banc) (police officer raped motorist after placing her under arrest); Doev. Samaritan Counseling Ctr., 791 P.2d 344, 348—349 (Alaska 1990) (therapist had sexual relations with patient); Turner v.State, 494 So. 2d 1291, 1296 (La. App. 1986) (National Guard recruiting officer committed sexual battery during sham physical examinations); Lyon v. Carey, 533 F.2d 649, 655 (CADC 1976) (furniture deliveryman raped recipient of furniture); Samuels v.Southern Baptist Hospital, 594 So. 2d 571, 574 (La. App. 1992) (nursing assistant raped patient).2 The rationales for these decisions have varied, with some courts echoing Bushey in explaining that the employees’s acts were foreseeable and that the employer should in fairness bear the resulting costs of doing business, see, e.g., Mary M., supra, at 218, 814 P.2d., at 1350, and others finding that the employee’s sexual misconduct arose from or was in some way related to the employee’s essential duties. See, e.g., Samuels, supra, at 574 (tortious conduct was “reason-\nably incidental” to the performance of the nursing assistant’s duties in caring for a “helpless” patient in a “locked environment”).\nAn assignment to reconcile the run of the Title VII cases with those just cited would be a taxing one. Here it is enough to recognize that their disparate results do not necessarily reflect wildly varying terms of the particular employment contracts involved, but represent differing judgments about the desirability of holding an employer liable for his subordinates’ wayward behavior. In the instances in which there is a genuine question about the employer’s responsibility for harmful conduct he did not in fact authorize, a holding that the conduct falls within the scope of employment ultimately expresses a conclusion not of fact but of law. As one eminent authority has observed, the “highly indefinite phrase” is “devoid of meaning in itself” and is “obviously no more than a bare formula to cover the unordered and unauthorized acts of the servant for which it is found to be expedient to charge the master with liability, as well as to exclude other acts for which it is not.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keaton on the Law of Torts 502 (5th ed. 1984); see also Seavey, Speculations as to “Respondeat Superior,” in Studies in Agency 129, 155 (1949) (“The liability of a master to a third person for the torts of a servant has been widely extended by aid of the elastic phrase ‘scope of the employment’ which may be used to include all which the court wishes to put into it”). Older cases, for example, treated smoking by an employee during working hours as an act outside the scope of employment, but more recently courts have generally held smoking on the job to fall within the scope. Prosser & Keeton, supra, at 504, and n. 23. It is not that employers formerly did not authorize smoking but have now begun to do so, or that employees previously smoked for their own purposes but now do so to serve the employer. We simply understand smoking differently now and have revised the old judgments about what ought to be done about it.\nThe proper analysis here, then, calls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the Restatement, see, e.g., §§219, 228, 229, but rather an enquiry into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor’s employment, and the reasons for the opposite view. The Restatement itself points to such an approach, as in the commentary that the “ultimate question” in determining the scope of employment is “whether or not it is just that the loss resulting from the servant’s acts should be considered as one of the normal risks to be borne by the business in which the servant is employed.” Id., §229, Comment a. See generally Taber v.Maine, 67 F.3d 1029, 1037 (CA2 1995) (“As the leading Torts treatise has put it, ‘the integrating principle’ of respondeat superior is ‘that the employer should be liable for those faults that may be fairly regarded as risks of his business, whether they are committed in furthering it or not’ ”) (quoting 5 F. Harper, F. James & O. Gray, Law of Torts §26.8, pp. 40—41 (2d ed. 1986)\nIn the case before us, a justification for holding the offensive behavior within the scope of Terry’s and Silverman’s employment was well put in Judge Barkett’s dissent: “[A] pervasively hostile work environment of sexual harassment is never (one would hope) authorized, but the supervisor is clearly charged with maintaining a productive, safe work environment. The supervisor directs and controls the conduct of the employees, and the manner of doing so may inure to the employer’s benefit or detriment, including subjecting the employer to Title VII liability.” 111 F.3d, at 1542 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is by now well recognized that hostile environment sexual harassment by supervisors (and, for that matter, co-employees) is a persistent problem in the workplace. See Lindemann & Kadue 4—5 (discussing studies showing prevalence of sexual harassment); Ellerth, 123 F.3d, at 511 (Posner, C. J., concurring and dissenting) (“[E]veryone knows by now that sexual harassment is a common problem in the American workplace”). An employer can, in a general sense, reasonably anticipate the possibility of such conduct occurring in its workplace, and one might justify the assignment of the burden of the untoward behavior to the employer as one of the costs of doing business, to be charged to the enterprise rather than the victim. As noted, supra, at 17—18, developments like this occur from time to time in the law of agency.\nTwo things counsel us to draw the contrary conclusion. First, there is no reason to suppose that Congress wished courts to ignore the traditional distinction between acts falling within the scope and acts amounting to what the older law called frolics or detours from the course of employment. Such a distinction can readily be applied to the spectrum of possible harassing conduct by supervisors, as the following examples show. First, a supervisor might discriminate racially in job assignments in order to placate the prejudice pervasive in the labor force. Instances of this variety of the heckler’s veto would be consciously intended to further the employer’s interests by preserving peace in the workplace. Next, supervisors might reprimand male employees for workplace failings with banter, but respond to women’s shortcomings in harsh or vulgar terms. A third example might be the supervisor who, as here, expresses his sexual interests in ways having no apparent object whatever of serving an interest of the employer. If a line is to be drawn between scope and frolic, it would lie between the first two examples and the third, and it thus makes sense in terms of traditional agency law to analyze the scope issue, in cases like the third example, just as most federal courts addressing that issue have done, classifying the harassment as beyond the scope of employment.\nThe second reason goes to an even broader unanimity of views among the holdings of District Courts and Courts of Appeals thus far. Those courts have held not only that the sort of harassment at issue here was outside the scope of supervisors’ authority, but, by uniformly judging employer liability for co-worker harassment under a negligence standard, they have also implicitly treated such harassment as outside the scope of common employees’ duties as well. See Blankenship v. Parke Care Centers, Inc., 123 F.3d 868, 872—873 (CA6 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. ___ (1998);Fleming v. Boeing Co., 120 F.3d 242, 246 (CA11 1997); Perry v.Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143, 149 (CA2 1997); Yamaguchi v.United States Dept. of Air Force, 109 F.3d 1475, 1483 (CA9 1997);Varner v. National Super Markets, Inc., 94 F.3d 1209, 1213 (CA8 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. ___ (1997); McKenzie v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 92 F.3d 473, 480 (CA7 1996); Andrade, 88 F.3d, at 261;Waymire v. Harris County, 86 F.3d 424, 428—429 (CA5 1996);Hirase-Doi v. U.S. West Communications, Inc., 61 F.3d 777, 783 (CA10 1995); Andrews v. Philadelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1486 (CA3 1990); cf. Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108 F.3d 429, 438 (CA1 1997) (applying “knew or should have known” standard to claims of environmental harassment by a supervisor); see also29 CFR § 1604.11(d) (1997) (employer is liable for co-worker harassment if it “knows or should have known of the conduct, unless it can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action”); 3 L. Larson & A. Larson, Employment Discrimination §46.07[4][a], p. 46—101 (2d ed. 1998) (courts “uniformly” apply EEOC rule; “[i]t is not a controversial area”). If, indeed, the cases did not rest, at least implicitly, on the notion that such harassment falls outside the scope of employment, their liability issues would have turned simply on the application of the scope- of-employment rule. Cf. Hunter v. Allis-Chalmers, Inc., 797 F.2d 1417, 1422 (CA7 1986) (noting that employer will not usually be liable under respondeat superior for employee’s racial harassment because it “would be the rare case where racial harassment . . . could be thought\nby the author of the harassment to help the employer’s business”).\nIt is quite unlikely that these cases would escape efforts to render them obsolete if we were to hold that supervisors who engage in discriminatory harassment are necessarily acting within the scope of their employment. The rationale for placing harassment within the scope of supervisory authority would be the fairness of requiring the employer to bear the burden of foreseeable social behavior, and the same rationale would apply when the behavior was that of co-employees. The employer generally benefits just as obviously from the work of common employees as from the work of supervisors; they simply have different jobs to do, all aimed at the success of the enterprise. As between an innocent employer and an innocent employee, if we use scope of employment reasoning to require the employer to bear the cost of an actionably hostile workplace created by one class of employees (i.e., supervisors), it could appear just as appropriate to do the same when the environment was created by another class (i.e., co-workers).\nThe answer to this argument might well be to point out that the scope of supervisory employment may be treated separately by recognizing that supervisors have special authority enhancing their capacity to harass, and that the employer can guard against their misbehavior more easily because their numbers are by definition fewer than the numbers of regular employees. But this answer happens to implicate an entirely separate category of agency law (to be considered in the next section), which imposes vicarious liability on employers for tortious acts committed by use of particular authority conferred as an element of an employee’s agency relationship with the employer. Since the virtue of categorical clarity is obvious, it is better to reject reliance on misuse of supervisory authority (without more) as irrelevant to scope-of-employment analysis.\n2\nThe Court of Appeals also rejected vicarious liability on the part of the City insofar as it might rest on the concluding principle set forth in §219(2)(d) of the Restatement, that an employer “is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment unless … the servant purported to act or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance on apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.” Faragher points to several ways in which the agency relationship aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She argues that in general offending supervisors can abuse their authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make offensive statements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint. Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by the City enabled them to act for so long without provoking defiance or complaint.\nThe City, however, contends that §219(2)(d) has no application here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant “aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation,” merely “refines” the one preceding it, which holds the\nemployer vicariously liable for its servant’s abuse of apparent authority. Brief for Respondent 30—31, and n. 24. But this narrow reading is untenable; it would render the second qualification of §219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to ask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisory authority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it covers not only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, but also to cases in which tortious conduct is made possible or facilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship. See Restatement §219 Comment e(noting employer liability where “the servant may be able to cause harm because of his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sends false messages purporting to come from third persons” and where the manager who operates a store “for an undisclosed principal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his position”); §247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper’s liability for a libelous editorial published by an editor acting for his own purposes).\nWe therefore agree with Faragher that in implementing Title VII it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some tortious conduct of a supervisor made possible by abuse of his supervisory authority, and that the aided-by-agency-relation principle embodied in §219(2)(d) of the Restatement provides an appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind of harassment presented here.3 Several courts, indeed, have noted what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a harassing supervisor is always assisted in his misconduct by the supervisory relationship. See, e.g., Rodgers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 668, 675 (CA7 1993); Taylor v. Metzger, 152 N. J. 490, 505, 706 A. 2d 685, 692 (1998) (emphasizing that a supervisor’s conduct may have a greater impact than that of colleagues at the same level); cf. Torres, 116 F.3d, at 631. See also White v. Monsanto Co., 585 So. 2d 1205, 1209—1210 (La. 1991) (a supervisor’s harassment of a subordinate is more apt to rise to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress than comparable harassment by a co-employee); Contreras v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 88 Wash. 2d 735, 740, 565 P.2d 1173, 1176 (1977) (same); Alcorn v. Anbro Engineering, Inc., 2 Cal. 3d 493, 498—499, and n. 2, 468 P.2d 216, 218—219, and n. 2 (1970) (same). The agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor’s sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the whistle on a superior. When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in the terms and conditions of subordinates’ employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position over the people who report to him, or those under them, whereas an employee generally cannot check a supervisor’s abusive conduct the same way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker. When a fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk away or tell the offender where to go, but it may be difficult to offer such responses to a supervisor, whose “power to supervise–[which may be] to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates–does not disappear . . . when he chooses to harass through insults and offensive gestures rather than directly with threats of firing or promises of promotion.” Estrich, Sex at Work, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 813, 854 (1991). Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse of supervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of a victim’s employment is underscored by the fact that the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor their performance.\nIn sum, there are good reasons for vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory authority. That rationale must, however, satisfy one more condition. We are not entitled to recognize this theory under Title VII unless we can square it with Meritor’s holding that an employer is not “automatically” liable for harassment by a supervisor who creates the requisite degree of discrimination,4and there is obviously some tension between that holding and the position that a supervisor’s misconduct aided by supervisory authority subjects the employer to liability vicariously; if the “aid” may be the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of supervisory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high. To counter it, we think there are two basic alternatives, one being to require proof of some affirmative invocation of that authority by the harassing supervisor, the other to recognize an affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionable environment.\nThere is certainly some authority for requiring active or affirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse of supervisory authority before liability may be imputed. That is the way some courts have viewed the familiar cases holding the employer liable for discriminatory employment action with tangible consequences, like firing and demotion. See supra, at 11—12. And we have already noted some examples of liability provided by the Restatement itself, which suggests that an affirmative misuse of power might be required. See supra, at 23—24 (telegraph operator sends false messages, a store manager cheats customers, editor publishes libelous editorial).\nBut neat examples illustrating the line between the affirmative and merely implicit uses of power are not easy to come by in considering management behavior. Supervisors do not make speeches threatening sanctions whenever they make requests in the legitimate exercise of managerial authority, and yet every subordinate employee knows the sanctions exist; this is the reason that courts have consistently held that acts of supervisors have greater power to alter the environment than acts of co-employees generally, see supra, at 24—25. How far from the course of ostensible supervisory behavior would a company officer have to step before his orders would not reasonably be seen as actively using authority? Judgment calls would often be close, the results would often seem disparate even if not demonstrably contradictory, and the temptation to litigate would be hard to resist. We think plaintiffs and defendants alike would be poorly served by an active-use rule.\nThe other basic alternative to automatic liability would avoid this particular temptation to litigate, but allow an employer to show as an affirmative defense to liability that the employer had exercised reasonable care to avoid harassment and to eliminate it when it might occur, and that the complaining employee had failed to act with like reasonable care to take advantage of the employer’s safeguards and otherwise to prevent harm that could have been avoided. This composite defense would, we think, implement the statute sensibly, for reasons that are not hard to fathom.\nAlthough Title VII seeks “to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination,”Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 418 (1975), its “primary objective,” like that of any statute meant to influence primary conduct, is not to provide redress but to avoid harm. Id.,at 417. As long ago as 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), charged with the enforcement of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e—4, adopted regulations advising employers to “take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as . . . informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment.” 29 CFR § 1604.11(f) (1997), and in 1990 the Commission issued a policy statement enjoining employers to establish a complaint procedure “designed to encourage victims of harassment to come forward [without requiring] a victim to complain first to the offending supervisor.” EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment, 8 FEP Manual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government’s Title VII enforcement efforts to recognize the employer’s affirmative obligation to prevent violations and give credit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty. Indeed, a theory of vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory power would be at odds with the statutory policy if it failed to provide employers with some such incentive.\nThe requirement to show that the employee has failed in a coordinate duty to avoid or mitigate harm reflects an equally obvious policy imported from the general theory of damages, that a victim has a duty “to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages” that result from violations of the statute. Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982) (quoting C. McCormick, Law of Damages 127 (1935) (internal quotation marks omitted). An employer may, for example, have provided a proven, effective mechanism for reporting and resolving complaints of sexual harassment, available to the employee without undue risk or expense. If the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the employer’s preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could have been avoided if she had done so. If the victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found against the employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages could reasonably have been mitigated no award against a liable employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could have avoided.\nIn order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII’s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in Burlington Industries, Inc. v.Ellerth, ante, p. __, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule. Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer’s burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor’s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. See Burlington, ante, at 17.\nApplying these rules here, we believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed. The District Court found that the degree of hostility in the work environment rose to the actionable level and was attributable to Silverman and Terry. It is undisputed that these supervisors “were granted virtually unchecked authority” over their subordinates, “directly controll[ing] and supervis[ing] all aspects of [Faragher’s] day-to-day activities.” 111 F.3d, at, 1544 (Barkett, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). It is also clear that Faragher and her colleagues were “completely isolated from the City’s higher management.” Ibid. The City did not seek review of these findings.\nWhile the City would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative defense if there were any serious prospect of its presenting one, it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The District Court found that the City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like Terry and Silverman. The record also makes clear that the City’s policy did not include any assurance that the harassing supervisors could be bypassed in registering complaints. App. 274. Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors’ harassing conduct. Unlike the employer of a small workforce, who might expect that sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior could be exercised informally, those responsible for city operations could not reasonably have thought that precautions against hostile environments in any one of many departments in far-flung locations could be effective without communicating some formal policy against harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.\nWe have drawn this conclusion without overlooking two possible grounds upon which the City might argue for the opportunity to litigate further. There is, first, the Court of Appeals’s indulgent gloss on the relevant evidence: “There is some evidence that the City did not effectively disseminate among Marine Safety employees its sexual harassment policy.” Id., at 1539, n. 11. But, in contrast to the Court of Appeals’s characterization, the District Court made an explicit finding of a “complete failure on the part of the City to disseminate said policy among Marine Safety Section employees.” 864 F. Supp., at 1560. The evidence supports the District Court’s finding and there is no contrary claim before us.\nThe second possible ground for pursuing a defense was asserted by the City in its argument addressing the possibility of negligence liability in this case. It said that it should not be held liable for failing to promulgate an antiharassment policy, because there was no apparent duty to do so in the 1985—1990 period. The City purports to rest this argument on the position of the EEOC during the period mentioned, but it turns out that the record on this point is quite against the City’s position. Although the EEOC issued regulations dealing with promulgating a statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990, see supra, at 28, ever since 1980 its regulations have called for steps to prevent violations, such as informing employees of their rights and the means to assert them. Ibid. The City, after all, adopted an antiharassment policy in 1986.\nThe City points to nothing that might justify a conclusion by the District Court on remand that the City had exercised reasonable care. Nor is there any reason to\nremand for consideration of Faragher's efforts to miti-\ngate her own damages, since the award to her was solely nominal.\n3\nThe Court of Appeals also rejected the possibility that it could hold the City liable for the reason that it knew of the harassment vicariously through the knowledge of its supervisors. We have no occasion to consider whether this was error, however. We are satisfied that liability on the ground of vicarious knowledge could not be determined without further factfinding on remand, whereas the reversal necessary on the theory of supervisory harassment renders any remand for consideration of imputed knowledge entirely unjustifiable (as would be any consideration of negligence as an alternative to a theory of vicarious liability here).\nIII\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court.\n________________________________________\nNOTES\n1. Similarly, Courts of Appeals in sexual harassment cases have properly drawn on standards developed in cases involving racial harassment. See, e.g., Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth., 890 F.2d 569, 577 (CA2 1989) (citing Lopez v. S. B. Thomas, Inc., 831 F.2d 1184, 1189 (CA2 1987), a case of racial harassment, for the proposition that incidents of environmental sexual harassment “must be more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive”). Although racial and sexual harassment will often take different forms, and standards my not be entirely interchangeable, we think there is good sense in seeking generally to harmonize the standards of what amounts to actionable harassment.\n2. It bears noting that many courts in non-Title VII cases have held sexual assaults to fall outside the scope of employment. See Note, “Scope of Employment” Redefined: Holding Employers Vicariously Liable for Sexual Assaults Committed by their Employees, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 1513, 1521—1522, and nn. 33, 34 (1992)(collecting cases).\n3. We say “starting point” because our obligation here is not to make a pronouncement of agency law in general or to transplant §219(2)(d) into Title VII. Rather, it is to adapt agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII. As we said in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 72 (1986), “common-law principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII.”\n4. We are bound to honor Meritor on this point not merely because of the high value placed on stare decisis in statutory interpretation, supra, at 13—14, but for a further reason as well. With the amendments enacted by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress both expanded the monetary relief available under Title VII to include compensatory and punitive damages, see §102, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U.S.C. § 1981a and modified the statutory grounds of several of our decisions, see §101 et seq. The decision of Congress to leave Meritor intact is conspicuous. We thus have to assume that in expanding employers’ potential liability under Title VII, Congress relied on our statements in Meritor about the limits of employer liability. To disregard those statements now (even if we were convinced of reasons for doing so) would be not only to disregard stare decisis in statutory interpretation, but to substitute our revised judgment about the proper allocation of the costs of harassment for Congress’s considered decision on the subject. \n",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6505,,LawOpinionsResearch,OpinionSCOTUS,LongText,12,,,"<center><b>UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT</b>\nTEXAS DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS v. BURDINE</center>\n\nNo. 79-1764.\n\nArgued: Dec. 9, 1980.\n\nDecided: March 4, 1981.\n\nOpinion, POWELL [HTML]\nSyllabus\n\nRespondent filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that her termination of employment with petitioner was predicated on gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The District Court found that the testimony for petitioner sufficiently had rebutted respondent's allegation of gender discrimination in the decision to terminate her employment. The Court of Appeals reversed this finding, holding that the defendant in a Title VII case bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action and also must prove by objective evidence that those hired were better qualified that the plaintiff, and that the testimony for petitioner did not carry either of these burdens.\n\nHeld: When the plaintiff in a Title VII case has proved a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the defendant bears only the burden of explaining clearly the nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Pp. 252-260.\n\n(a) As set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, the basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case, is as follows. First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection."" Id., at 802, 93 S.Ct., at 1824. third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination. The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons, but it is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection. Pp. 252-256.\n\n(b) The Court of Appeals erred by requiring petitioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating respondent. By doing this, the court required much more than is required by McDonnell Douglas, supra, and its progeny: it placed on petitioner the burden of persuading the court that it had convincing, objective reasons for preferring the chosen applicant above the respondent. Limiting the defendant's evidentiary obligation to a burden of production will not unduly hinder the plaintiff. Pp. 256-258.\n\n(c) The Court of Appeals also erred in requiring petitioner to prove by objective evidence that the person hired was more qualified than respondent. It is the plaintiff's task to demonstrate that similarly situated employees were not treated equally, but the Court of Appeals' rule would require the employer to show that the plaintiff's objective qualifications were inferior to those of the person selected, and if it cannot, a court would, in effect, conclude that it has discriminated. The Court of Appeals' views can also be read as requiring the employer to hire the minority or female applicant whenever that person's objective qualifications were equal to those of a white male applicant. But Title VII does not obligate an employer to accord this preference. Rather, the employer has discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates, provided the decision is not based upon unlawful criteria. Pp. 258-259.\n\n608 F.2d 563, vacated and remanded.\n\nGregory Wilson, Austin, Tex., for petitioner, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court.\n\nHubert L. Gill, Austin, Tex., for respondent.\n\nTOP\n\nJustice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case requires us to address again the nature of the evidentiary burden placed upon the defendant in an employment discrimination suit brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. The narrow question presented is whether, after the plaintiff has proved a prima facie case of discriminatory treatment, the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the court by a preponderance of the evidence that legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the challenged employment action existed.\n\n* Petitioner, the Texas Department of Community Affairs (TDCA), hired respondent, a female, in January 1972, for the position of accounting clerk in the Public Service Careers Division (PSC). PSC provided training and employment opportunities in the public sector for unskilled workers. When hired, respondent possessed several years' experience in employment training. She was promoted to Field Services Coordinator in July 1972. Her supervisor resigned in November of that year, and respondent was assigned additional duties. Although she applied for the supervisor's position of Project Director, the position remained vacant for six months.\n\nPSC was funded completely by the United States Department of Labor. The Department was seriously concerned about inefficiencies at PSC. 1 In February 1973, the Department notified the Executive Director of TDCA, B. R. Fuller, that it would terminate PSC the following month. TDCA officials, assisted by respondent, persuaded the Department to continue funding the program, conditioned upon PSC's reforming its operations. Among the agreed conditions were the appointment of a permanent Project Director and a complete reorganization of the PSC staff. 2\n\nAfter consulting with personnel within TDCA, Fuller hired a male from another division of the agency as Project Director. In reducing the PSC staff, he fired respondent along with two other employees, and retained another male, Walz, as the only professional employee in the division. It is undisputed that respondent had maintained her application for the position of Project Director and had requested to remain with TDCA. Respondent soon was rehired by TDCA and assigned to another division of the agency. She received the exact salary paid to the Project Director at PSC, and the subsequent promotions she has received have kept her salary and responsibility commensurate with what she would have received had she been appointed Project Director.\n\nRespondent filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged that the failure to promote and the subsequent decision to terminate her had been predicated on gender discrimination in violation of Title VII. After a bench trial, the District Court held that neither decision was based on gender discrimination. The court relied on the testimony of Fuller that the employment decisions necessitated by the commands of the Department of Labor were based on consultation among trusted advisers and a nondiscriminatory evaluation of the relative qualifications of the individuals involved. He testified that the three individuals terminated did not work well together, and that TDCA thought that eliminating this problem would improve PSC's efficiency. The court accepted this explanation as rational and, in effect, found no evidence that the decisions not to promote and to terminate respondent were prompted by gender discrimination.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed in part. 608 F.2d 563 (1979). The court held that the District Court's ""implicit evidentiary finding"" that the male hired as Project Director was better qualified for that position than respondent was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the court affirmed the District Court's finding that respondent was not discriminated against when she was not promoted. The Court of Appeals, however, reversed the District Court's finding that Fuller's testimony sufficiently had rebutted respondent's prima facie case of gender discrimination in the decision to terminate her employment at PSC. The court reaffirmed its previously announced views that the defendant in a Title VII case bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for the employment action and that the defendant also must prove by objective evidence that those hired or promoted were better qualified than the plaintiff. The court found that Fuller's testimony did not carry either of these evidentiary burdens. It, therefore, reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case for computation of backpay. 3 Because the decision of the Court of Appeals as to the burden of proof borne by the defendant conflicts with interpretations of our precedents adopted by other Courts of Appeals, 4 we granted certiorari. 447 U.S. 920, 100 S.Ct. 3009, 65 L.Ed.2d 1112 (1980). We now vacate the Fifth Circuit's decision and remand for application of the correct standard.\n\nII\n\nIn McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), we set forth the basic allocation of burdens and order of presentation of proof in a Title VII case alleging discriminatory treatment. 5 First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection."" Id., at 802, 93 S.Ct., at 1824. Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 804, 93 S.Ct., at 1825.\n\nThe nature of the burden that shifts to the defendant should be understood in light of the plaintiff's ultimate and intermediate burdens. The ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. See Board of Trustees of Keene State College v. Sweeney, 439 U.S. 24, 25, n. 2, 99 S.Ct. 295, 296, n. 2, 58 L.Ed.2d 216 (1978); id., at 29, 99 S.Ct., at 297 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). See generally 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2489 (3d ed. 1940) (the burden of persuasion ""never shifts""). The McDonnell Douglas division of intermediate evidentiary burdens serves to bring the litigants and the court expeditiously and fairly to this ultimate question.\n\nThe burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous. The plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she applied for an available position for which she was qualified, but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. 6 The prima facie case serves an important function in the litigation: it eliminates the most common nondiscriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's rejection. See Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 358, and n. 44, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1866, n. 44, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). As the Court explained in Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978), the prima facie case ""raises an inference of discrimination only because we presume these acts, if otherwise unexplained, are more likely than not based on the consideration of impermissible factors."" Establishment of the prima facie case in effect creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. If the trier of fact believes the plaintiff's evidence, and if the employer is silent in the face of the presumption, the court must enter judgment for the plaintiff because no issue of fact remains in the case. 7\n\nThe burden that shifts to the defendant, therefore, is to rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. See Sweeney, supra, at 25, 99 S.Ct., at 296. It is sufficient if the defendant's evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff. 8 To accomplish this, the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection. 9 The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the defendant. If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, 10 and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity. Placing this burden of production on the defendant thus serves simultaneously to meet the plaintiff's prima facie case by presenting a legitimate reason for the action and to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext. The sufficiency of the defendant's evidence should be evaluated by the extent to which it fulfills these functions.\n\nThe plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion. She now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination. She may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S., at 804-805, 93 S.Ct., at 1825-1826.\n\nIII\n\nIn reversing the judgment of the District Court that the discharge of respondent from PSC was unrelated to her sex, the Court of Appeals adhered to two rules it had developed to elaborate the defendant's burden of proof. First, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for the discharge existed. 608 F.2d, at 567. See Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 555 F.2d 1251, 1255 (CA5 1977). Second, to satisfy this burden, the defendant ""must prove that those he hired . . . were somehow better qualified than was plaintiff; in other words, comparative evidence is needed."" 608 F.2d, at 567 (emphasis in original). See East v. Romine, Inc., 518 F.2d 332, 339-340 (CA5 1975).\n\nThe Court of Appeals has misconstrued the nature of the burden that McDonnell Douglas and its progeny place on the defendant. See Part II, supra. We stated in Sweeney that ""the employer's burden is satisfied if he simply 'explains what he has done' or 'produces evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.' "" 439 U.S., at 25, n. 2, 99 S.Ct., at 296 n. 2, quoting id., at 28, 29, 99 S.Ct., at 297-298 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). It is plain that the Court of Appeals required much more: it placed on the defendant the burden of persuading the court that it had convincing, objective reasons for preferring the chosen applicant above the plaintiff. 11\n\nThe Court of Appeals distinguished Sweeney on the ground that the case held only that the defendant did not have the burden of proving the absence of discriminatory intent. But this distinction slights the rationale of Sweeney and of our other cases. We have stated consistently that the employee's prima facie case of discrimination will be rebutted if the employer articulates lawful reasons for the action; that is, to satisfy this intermediate burden, the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus. The Court of Appeals would require the defendant to introduce evidence which, in the absence of any evidence of pretext, would persuade the trier of fact that the employment action was lawful. This exceeds what properly can be demanded to satisfy a burden of production.\n\nThe court placed the burden of persuasion on the defendant apparently because it feared that ""if an employer need only articulate—not prove—a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his action, he may compose fictitious, but legitimate, reasons for his actions."" Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., supra, at 1255 (emphasis in original). We do not believe, however, that limiting the defendant's evidentiary obligation to a burden of production will unduly hinder the plaintiff. First, as noted above, the defendant's explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and reasonably specific. Supra, at 255. See Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1011-1012, n. 5 (CA1 1979). This obligation arises both from the necessity of rebutting the inference of discrimination arising from the prima facie case and from the requirement that the plaintiff be afforded ""a full and fair opportunity"" to demonstrate pretext. Second, although the defendant does not bear a formal burden of persuasion, the defendant nevertheless retains an incentive to persuade the trier of fact that the employment decision was lawful. Thus, the defendant normally will attempt to prove the factual basis for its explanation. Third, the liberal discovery rules applicable to any civil suit in federal court are supplemented in a Title VII suit by the plaintiff's access to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's investigatory files concerning her complaint. See EEOC v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 449 U.S. 590, 101 S.Ct. 817, 66 L.Ed.2d 762 (1981). Given these factors, we are unpersuaded that the plaintiff will find it particularly difficult to prove that a proffered explanation lacking a factual basis is a pretext. We remain confident that the McDonnell Douglas framework permits the plaintiff meriting relief to demonstrate intentional discrimination.\n\nB\n\nThe Court of Appeals also erred in requiring the defendant to prove by objective evidence that the person hired or promoted was more qualified than the plaintiff. McDonnell Douglas teaches that it is the plaintiff's task to demonstrate that similarly situated employees were not treated equally. 411 U.S., at 804, 93 S.Ct., at 1825. The Court of Appeals' rule would require the employer to show that the plaintiff's objective qualifications were inferior to those of the person selected. If it cannot, a court would, in effect, conclude that it has discriminated.\n\nThe court's procedural rule harbors a substantive error. Title VII prohibits all discrimination in employment based upon race, sex, and national origin. ""The broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer, is efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and . . . neutral employment and personnel decisions."" McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 801, 93 S.Ct., at 1823. Title VII, however, does not demand that an employer give preferential treatment to minorities or women. 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(j). See Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 205-206, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 2728-2729, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979). The statute was not intended to ""diminish traditional management prerogatives."" Id., at 207, 99 S.Ct., at 2729. It does not require the employer to restructure his employment practices to maximize the number of minorities and women hired. Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577-578, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949-2950, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978).\n\nThe views of the Court of Appeals can be read, we think, as requiring the employer to hire the minority or female applicant whenever that person's objective qualifications were equal to those of a white male applicant. But Title VII does not obligate an employer to accord this preference. Rather, the employer has discretion to choose among equally qualified candidates, provided the decision is not based upon unlawful criteria. The fact that a court may think that the employer misjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself expose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative of whether the employer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination. Loeb v. Textron, Inc., supra, at 1012, n. 6; see Lieberman v. Gant, 630 F.2d 60, 65 (CA2 1980).\n\nIV\n\nIn summary, the Court of Appeals erred by requiring the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating the respondent and that the person retained in her stead had superior objective qualifications for the position. 12 When the plaintiff has proved a prima facie case of discrimination, the defendant bears only the burden of explaining clearly the nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nCC∅ | Transformed by Public.Resource.Org\n\n1\n\nAmong the problems identified were overstaffing, lack of fiscal control, poor bookkeeping, lack of communication among PSC staff, and the lack of a full-time Project Director. Letter of March 20, 1973, from Charles Johnson to B. R. Fuller, reprinted in App. 38-40.\n\n2\n\nSee id., at 39.\n\n3\n\nThe Court of Appeals also vacated the District Court's judgment that petitioner did not violate Title VII's equal pay provision, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(h), but that decision is not challenged here.\n\n4\n\nSee, e. g., Lieberman v. Gant, 630 F.2d 60 (CA2 1980); Jackson v. U. S. Steel Corp., 624 F.2d 436 (CA3 1980); Ambush v. Montgomery County Government, 620 F.2d 1048 (CA4 1980); Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003 (CA1 1979). But see Vaughn v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 620 F.2d 655 (CA8 1980), cert. pending, No. 80-276.\n\n5\n\nWe have recognized that the factual issues, and therefore the character of the evidence presented, differ when the plaintiff claims that a facially neutral employment policy has a discriminatory impact on protected classes. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S., at 802, n. 14, 93 S.Ct., at 1824 n. 14; Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335-336, and n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1854-1855, n. 15, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).\n\n6\n\nIn McDonnell Douglas, supra, we described an appropriate model for a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The plaintiff must show:\n\n""(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant's qualifications."" 411 U.S., at 802, 93 S.Ct., at 1824.\n\nWe added, however, that this standard is not inflexible, as ""[t]he facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification above of the prima facie proof required from respondent is not necessarily applicable in every respect in differing factual situations."" Id., at 802, n. 13, 93 S.Ct., at 1824 n. 13.\n\nIn the instant case, it is not seriously contested that respondent has proved a prima facie case. She showed that she was a qualified woman who sought an available position, but the position was left open for several months before she finally was rejected in favor of a male, Walz, who had been under her supervision.\n\n7\n\nThe phrase ""prima facie case"" not only may denote the establishment of a legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption, but also may be used by courts to describe the plaintiff's burden of producing enough evidence to permit the trier of fact to infer the fact at issue. 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2494 (3d ed. 1940). McDonnell Douglas should have made it apparent that in the Title VII context we use ""prima facie case"" in the former sense.\n\n8\n\nThis evidentiary relationship between the presumption created by a prima facie case and the consequential burden of production placed on the defendant is a traditional feature of the common law. ""The word 'presumption' properly used refers only to a device for allocating the production burden."" F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure § 7.9, p. 255 (2d ed. 1977) (footnote omitted). See Fed.Rule Evid. 301. See generally 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2491 (3d ed. 1940). Cf. J. Maguire, Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law 185-186 (1947). Usually, assessing the burden of production helps the judge determine whether the litigants have created an issue of fact to be decided by the jury. In a Title VII case, the allocation of burdens and the creation of a presumption by the establishment of a prima facie case is intended progressively to sharpen the inquiry into the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination.\n\n9\n\nAn articulation not admitted into evidence will not suffice. Thus, the defendant cannot meet its burden merely through an answer to the complaint or by argument of counsel.\n\n10\n\nSee generally J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence 346 (1898). In saying that the presumption drops from the case, we do not imply that the trier of fact no longer may consider evidence previously introduced by the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case. A satisfactory explanation by the defendant destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination arising from the plaintiff's initial evidence. Nonetheless, this evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom may be considered by the trier of fact on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual. Indeed, there may be some cases where the plaintiff's initial evidence, combined with effective cross-examination of the defendant, will suffice to discredit the defendant's explanation.\n\n11\n\nThe court reviewed the defendant's evidence and explained its deficiency:\n\n""Defendant failed to introduce comparative factual data concerning Burdine and Walz. Fuller merely testified that he discharged and retained personnel in the spring shakeup at TDCA primarily on the recommendations of subordinates and that he considered Walz qualified for the position he was retained to do. Fuller failed to specify any objective criteria on which he based the decision to discharge Burdine and retain Walz. He stated only that the action was in the best interest of the program and that there had been some friction within the department that might be alleviated by Burdine's discharge. Nothing in the record indicates whether he examined Walz' ability to work well with others. This court in East found such unsubstantiated assertions of 'qualification' and 'prior work record' insufficient absent data that will allow a true comparison of the individuals hired and rejected."" 608 F.2d, at 568.\n\n12\n\nBecause the Court of Appeals applied the wrong legal standard to the evidence, we have no occasion to decide whether it erred in not reviewing the District Court's finding of no intentional discrimination under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Addressing this issue in this case would be inappropriate because the District Court made no findings on the intermediate questions posed by McDonnell Douglas.",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

POTENCE\nv.\nHAZLETON AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT;\nGERALDINE S. SHEPPERSON\nHazleton Area School District,\n</center>\n\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\nThe Hazleton Area School District (the “School District”)\nappeals from the Amended Judgment and Order in favor of\nappellee Michael D. Potence pursuant to a jury verdict that\nthe School District had violated the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act (“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634. It also\nappeals from the award of attorneys’ fees.\nWe have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. Because we believe the District Court did\nnot abuse its discretion in denying the School District’s\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, and in denying its\nalternative motion for a new trial, and did not abuse its\ndiscretion in calculating the attorneys’ fees, we will affirm.\nI.\nThe School District posted an advertisement seeking to\nfill the vacant position of plumbing/HVAC (heating,\nventilation, and air conditioning) instructor. As posted, the\nadvertisement put forth the following job criteria: “Must\npossess or be eligible for PA plumbing and HVAC\ncertification. Must be able to document minimum two years\nrelated trade/technical experience in both occupations.”\nApp. at 237. Dr. Edward Lyba, administrative director of\nthe Hazleton Area Career Center, was appointed by\nSuperintendent Dr. Geraldine Shepperson to direct the\nhiring process.\nInitially five applications were submitted, and only one\ncandidate, Jeffrey Sweda, was selected for an interview.\nAfter receiving some pressure from the School Board, a\nsecond candidate, John Darrow, was interviewed, and\n2\ndespite the hiring committee’s recommendation that Sweda\nbe hired for the position, the School Board again directed\nDr. Lyba to interview yet another candidate, Michael\nPotence.\nThe entire original interview committee could not be\nreconvened for purposes of the interview with Potence, and\nDr. Lyba added a practical examination on which\napplicants had to name parts of a refrigeration unit. Sweda\nranked first, Potence second. Dr. Lyba recommended to\nSuperintendent Shepperson that Sweda be hired, and\nSweda was hired after the School Board approved his\nhiring. Potence filed suit claiming that he was discriminated\nagainst on the basis of his age.\nThe School District contends that Potence was not\nqualified for the job because he lacked a refrigerant\nrecapturing certification. Potence responds that this reason\nwas pretext because, among other things, this certification\nhas nothing to do with either HVAC or plumbing\ninstruction, and it was not listed in the advertisement for\nthe position. A member of the second interview committee,\nMr. Kevin Dodson, could not explain why a refrigeration\nexam was used to test plumbing, heating, ventilation, and\nair conditioning. There was trial evidence that the reasons\nprovided to Potence for not interviewing or hiring him\nchanged over time. He was initially told by Superintendent\nShepperson that he had failed to forward his educational\ntranscripts, but a postal receipt introduced in evidence\nshowed that his transcripts had been received in the\nrequired time period; then Dr. Shepperson told him that he\nwas “crying sour grapes” because the School Board had\nhired a fine young instructor; and finally he was told that\nhe was not hired because he was not certified in\nrefrigerants. App. at 7.\nPotence also adduced evidence at trial from which the\njury could have concluded that Dr. Shepperson had a\ndiscriminatory animus against older candidates and that\nshe had control over the hiring process. She directed Dr.\nLyba to hire “no more old plumbers,” and she told someone\nelse that “we are not going to hire any more old plumbers\nbecause the old plumbers cannot pass the certification\ntest.” Appellee’s Br. at 5-6. She also made a comment to\n3\nthe effect that the school had hired a “fine young man.”\nApp. at 7.1\nIt was against this factual background that the jury\nfound for Potence and awarded him $254,000 in damages,\nwhich the District Court reduced by $81,750 to reflect\nincome that Potence made in other employment. The court\nthen doubled the award as liquidated damages, pursuant to\nthe authority given in the ADEA for a court to do so for\n“willful” violations, 29 U.S.C. § 626(b), resulting in a\njudgment of $344,500. The District Court denied the School\nDistrict’s motion for judgment as a matter of law.\nII.\nIn pertinent part, the ADEA provides, “It shall be\nunlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to\ndischarge any individual or otherwise discriminate against\nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\nconditions, or privileges of employment because of such\nindividual’s age . . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a). The burdenshifting\nsequence in examining alleged employment\ndiscrimination was set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). The plaintiff must\nproduce sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable\nfactfinder as to all the elements of a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. If a plaintiff does establish a prima facie\ncase, then the burden of production shifts to the defendant\nto show that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the\nadverse employment decision. If the defendant does so, the\nplaintiff must submit evidence from which a factfinder\ncould reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer’s\narticulated reasons, or (2) believe that invidious\ndiscrimination was more likely than not the motivating or\ndeterminative cause of the employer’s action. Stanziale v.\nJargowsky, 200 F.3d 101, 105 (3d Cir. 2000).\nIn order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,\nthe plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) s/he is over forty, (2)\n1. The portion of the trial testimony quoted in this paragraph was not\nfiled of record, and is therefore taken from the Appellee’s brief and the\nDistrict Court’s opinion.\n4\nis qualified for the position in question, (3) suffered from an\nadverse employment decision, and (4) that his or her\nreplacement was sufficiently younger to permit a reasonable\ninference of age discrimination. Duffy v. Paper Magic Group,\nInc., 265 F.3d 163, 167 (3d Cir. 2001). The School District\nchallenges only the second of the criteria, and has asserted\nthroughout that Potence lacked the necessary\nqualifications.\nA. Whether the evidence showed that Potence was\nqualified for the position, and whether the lack of a\nrefrigerant certification was a pretext for\ndiscrimination.\nIn reviewing whether the School District was entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law, we must review the record in\nthe light most favorable to the prevailing party “unless the\nrecord is critically deficient of that minimum quantum of\nevidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief.”\nRotondo v. Keene Corp., 956 F.2d 436, 438 (3d Cir. 1992)\n(quotations and citations omitted). The School District’s\nonly argument that Potence was not qualified for the\nposition was that he lacked a federal certification to handle\nrefrigerants. Dr. Lyba testified that the School District had\npurchased diagnostic equipment relating to HVAC\ntroubleshooting, and that this equipment required the\noperator to introduce refrigerant into, and remove\nrefrigerant from, the machine. Because this equipment was\npurchased before the instructor position was advertised,\nthe School District argues the certification in question was\na prerequisite, rather than a pretext, for age discrimination.\nIt is undisputed that Potence did not possess this\ncertification, but there was sufficient evidence from which\nthe jury could have found that the School District’s reliance\non this qualification was a pretext for discrimination. It is\nnot contested that the advertisement for the position failed\nto list this as a qualification. The School District asserts\nthat it would not be reasonable to expect the advertisement\nto “put potential applicants on notice of every essential job\nqualification.” Appellant’s Br. at 21. In light of the fact that\nthe advertisement already listed plumbing and HVAC\ncertification as two of its criteria, the jury could reasonably\nhave concluded that “refrigerant” also would have been\n5\nincluded if it were an essential qualification. Another fact\nthat the jury could have considered in concluding the\nSchool District’s reason was pretext was that Potence was\ngiven various reasons at different stages of the hiring\nprocess as to why he was not hired or given an initial\ninterview. There was also testimony of several ageist\nremarks arguably attributable to Dr. Shepperson.\nThe School District nonetheless objects that Dr.\nShepperson was not in control of the hiring process. We\nhave held that stray remarks by non-decisionmakers alone\nare insufficient to establish discriminatory intent, Walden v.\nGeorgia-Pacific Corp., 126 F.3d 506, 513-14 (3d Cir. 1997),\nbut this argument fails in the instant case for two reasons.\nFirst, it is not only these remarks that give rise to an\ninference of discriminatory intent. The different stories told\nto Potence over the course of the process, the failure to\neven mention refrigerant certification in the notice of the\nposition, the unplanned decision to create a refrigerant\nexam at the end of the hiring process (after Dr. Lyba had\ntwice recommended Sweda for the position, and twice been\ntold to slow down) constitute sufficient evidence from which\na jury might have inferred discrimination. Second, and\nmore importantly, there is evidence on the record that Dr.\nShepperson did wield some influence over the process. We\nhave held that persons who have “the direct ability to\ninfluence hiring and firing decisions” may be held liable for\ndiscrimination. Levendos v. Stern Entertainment, Inc., 909\nF.2d 747, 752 (3d Cir. 1990). Dr. Shepperson was the\nperson who told Potence why he did not receive an\ninterview; she told the interviewing committee during\nPotence’s interview, “I am sorry you have to go through this\nagain because of some people;” and she testified that she\nwas ultimately responsible for all the hiring activities of the\nSchool District. App. at 8.\nThe School District presented evidence that she did not\nparticipate in the process. If we were sitting as jurors, we\nmight have found that evidence persuasive. However, we\nare not the jurors. The evidence viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict winner allowed a reasonable jury to\ninfer that Potence was qualified for the position and that\nthe refrigerant certification qualification served as a pretext\n6\nfor age discrimination. Therefore, we will affirm the District\nCourt’s denial of the motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\nB. Whether the District Court erred in failing to\nprovide the requested jury interrogatory.\nWe review the formulation of special interrogatories for\nabuse of discretion. Merritt Logan, Inc. v. Fleming Cos., 901\nF.2d 349, 367-68 (3d Cir. 1990). The special interrogatory\ngiven to the jury was, “Has Plaintiff, Michael Potence,\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nDefendant, Hazleton Area School District, discriminated\nagainst him on the basis of age in violation of the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act?” App. at 55-56. The\nSchool District requested that the Court include the\nfollowing special interrogatory, “Do you find that Mr. Sweda\nwould have been hired even if Mr. Potence’s age had not\nbeen considered?”, but the trial court denied that\ninterrogatory. App. at 206.\nThe School District contends that the District Court’s\nrefusal to include this question provided the jury with only\nhalf the applicable legal standard. We reject that\ncontention. It is not realistic to view the issue posed by this\ncase as consisting of two halves. There was one issue:\nwhether Potence was discriminated against in violation of\nthe ADEA.\nThe School District cites an opinion in which the court\nstated that “[i]n a complicated case such as this, the special\ninterrogatory device localizes and focalizes the specific\nproblems and issues whereas a general verdict often\npermits improper jury meandering.” Jamison Co. v.\nWestvaco Corp., 526 F.2d 922, 935 (5th Cir. 1976).\nHowever, at issue in that case was a contract and damages\ncomputation by the jury that had “many possible\nalternatives, asymetrical [sic] incongruencies, potential\nsolecisms, and error compounded upon error.” Id. In\ncontrast, the instant case is a straightforward\ndiscrimination claim with no such labyrinth for a juror to\nnavigate.\nThe District Court addressed the issue raised by the\nSchool District in the following jury charge: “If the Plaintiff\n7\nhas offered evidence from which you could conclude that\nthe Defendant School District discriminated against him\nbecause of his age, then the Plaintiff is entitled to recover\nunless the School District proves by a preponderance of the\nevidence that it would have taken the same action\nregardless of the Plaintiff ’s age.” App. at 11. Inasmuch as\nthe Court gave this charge, it did not abuse its discretion\nin declining to give the requested special verdict\ninterrogatory.\nC. Whether liquidated damages may be assessed\nagainst the School District under the ADEA.\nBased on the jury’s finding that the School District acted\nwillfully when it violated the ADEA, the District Court\ninvoked the liquidated damages provision of the ADEA and\ndoubled Potence’s award of damages. The School District\ncontends that it cannot be compelled to pay liquidated\ndamages due to its status as a municipality because\nliquidated damages are punitive in nature. We have not\npreviously considered this issue in the context of the\nstatutory framework of the ADEA. As we must interpret the\nrelevant provisions of the ADEA, the issue is a legal one\nover which we exercise plenary review. Smith v. Holtz, 210\nF.3d 186, 200 (3d Cir. 2000).\nThe ADEA incorporates the enforcement powers,\nremedies, and procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(“FLSA”) set forth in 29 U.S.C. §§ 211(b), 216 (except for\nsubsection (a)), and 217. 29 U.S.C. § 626(b). The\nenforcement provision of the FLSA expressly provides for\nimposition of liquidated damages payable “in cases of willful\nviolations of this chapter.” 29 U.S.C. § 626(b). The FLSA\nfurther provides that “[a]ny employer who violates [the\nFLSA] shall be liable to the employee or employees affected\nin the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their\nunpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in\nan additional equal amount as liquidated damages.” 29\nU.S.C. § 216(b). Thus, when a jury finds that an employer\nwillfully violated the ADEA, the basic damages award may\nbe doubled under this liquidated damages provision.\nThe School District argues that liquidated damages may\nnot be assessed against municipalities because they are\n8\npunitive. There is an historical tension between municipal\nliability and damages imposed as punishment. Cook County\nv. United States ex rel. Chandler, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 1246\n(2003). “Since municipalities’ common law resistance to\npunitive damages still obtains, ‘[t]he general rule today is\nthat no punitive damages are allowed unless expressly\nauthorized by statute.’” Id. (quoting Newport v. Fact\nConcerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 260 n.21 (1981)). In assessing\nwhether liquidated damages under the ADEA may be\nimposed against the municipality, represented here by the\nSchool District, we must address whether liquidated\ndamages under the ADEA are punitive and, if so, whether\nthe imposition of punitive damages against a municipality\nis expressly authorized by statute.\nBoth the Supreme Court and this court have held that\nthe liquidated damages provision of the ADEA was intended\nto be punitive in nature. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\nThurston, 469 U.S. 105, 126 (1985); Starceski v.\nWestinghouse Elec. Corp., 54 F.3d 1089, 1095 (3d Cir.\n1995). We must therefore examine the language of the\nstatute to make certain that it applies to municipalities.\nThe ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer “to fail or\nrefuse to hire or to discharge” an individual because of his\nor her age. 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). Included in the ADEA’s\ndefinition of employer is “a State or political subdivision of\na State and any agency or instrumentality of a State or a\npolitical subdivision of a State.” 29 U.S.C. § 630(b). The\nADEA could not be more explicit in imposing liability for\nage discrimination against municipalities. Similarly explicit\nis the ADEA’s contemplation of the imposition of liquidated\ndamages, as it states in pertinent part “[t]hat liquidated\ndamages shall be payable only in cases of willful violations\nof this chapter.” 29 U.S.C. § 626(b). The FLSA provisions\nincorporated in the ADEA provide for the imposition of\nliquidated damages “against any employer (including a\npublic agency),” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), and the statutory\ndefinition of a “public agency” includes “State[s] or political\nsubdivision[s] thereof,” 29 U.S.C. § 203(x).\nFurthermore, in dictum we assumed without deciding\nthat liquidated damages under the FLSA were available\nagainst a municipality. See Brooks v. Vill. of Ridgefield\n9\nPark, 185 F.3d 130, 137 (3d Cir. 1999); see also Ray v.\nIuka Special Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 51 F.3d 1246, 1253\n(5th Cir. 1995) (upholding award of liquidated damages\nagainst a school district under the ADEA when the issue on\nappeal was whether the school district had willfully violated\nthe ADEA); Lee v. Rapid City Area Sch. Dist. No. 51-4, 981\nF.2d 316, 319-20 (8th Cir. 1992) (en banc) (remanding for\nassessment of full liquidated damages against the school\ndistrict under the ADEA when the issue on appeal was\nwhether the district court erred in discretionarily reducing\nsuch damages); Orzel v. City of Wauwatosa Fire Dep’t, 697\nF.2d 743, 759 (7th Cir. 1983) (upholding liquidated\ndamages award against municipal fire department under\nthe ADEA when issue on appeal focused on willfulness).\nIn Cook County, the Supreme Court held that under the\nFalse Claims Act (“FCA”) treble damages could be imposed\nagainst municipalities because ever since the statute’s\ncreation in 1863 its definition of “person” was intended to\ncover local governments, and Congress did not manifest an\nintent to limit the scope of that definition when it raised the\nceiling on the damages in 1986. 123 S. Ct. at 1243-47. In\ncontrast to the FCA, which does not explicitly identify a\nmunicipality as a “person,” the ADEA, in the provisions\nquoted above, does explicitly include state and local\ngovernments in the definition of “employer.” Thus, we need\nnot move beyond the plain language of the statute or go to\nlengths to consider the historical context of the statute as\nthe Court did in Cook County. Rather, the language of the\nADEA itself makes it clear that Congress intended to\nsubject municipalities like the School District to the\nliquidated damages provision of the ADEA.\nInasmuch as the statute expressly authorizes the\nimposition of liquidated damages against a municipality,\neven though such damages are punitive in nature, we\nconclude that the District Court did not err in assessing\nliquidated damages against the School District.\nD. Whether the District Court erred in not reducing\nthe damages award by the amount of retirement\nbenefits that would have accrued to Potence.\nThe jury returned a verdict form that awarded $254,000\nin damages, and beneath that monetary figure wrote “back\n10\npay 3 2/3 years.” App. at 35. The School District asserts\nthat the award, which was intended to be for back pay,\nerroneously included $97,000 in retirement benefits that\nlegally constitutes front pay. The District Court rejected the\nSchool District’s argument that the amount of damages\nawarded was not supported by the record. The Court stated\nit would not “second guess the jury and reduce the award\nbecause of a remark written in the margin of the verdict\nwhich may have no relevance with respect to the actual\naward.” App. at 15.\nThe verdict form did not require the jury to differentiate\nbetween front pay and back pay, and therefore the written\nnote could have had no significance. Potence agrees with\nthe School District that the award was likely based on\nPotence’s salary schedule computation, which set forth the\nback pay calculation for 3-2/3 years as including $121,000\nin wages, $36,000 in medical coverage, and $97,000 in\nretirement benefits, App. at 82-94, 209-11, totaling\n$254,000, the precise amount of damages awarded by the\njury. However, the School District provides no case law\nsupporting its contention that retirement benefits are\nalways considered front pay. Potence presented evidence at\ntrial that $97,000 is the amount of the retirement benefits\nthat would have accrued to him during the relevant 3-2/3\nyears. Potence argues that the jury could have reasonably\nassumed that he would have worked with the School\nDistrict until the time when such benefits would vest,\nmaking these benefits part of earned back compensation.\nBecause a district court has an obligation “to uphold the\njury’s award if there exists a reasonable basis to do so,”\nand may not “vacate or reduce the award merely because it\nwould have granted a lesser amount of damages,” Evans v.\nPort Auth. of N.Y. & N.J., 273 F.3d 346, 351-52 (3d Cir.\n2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), we\nwill uphold the damages award.\nE. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in\ncalculating the reasonable rates for attorneys’ fees.\nWe review the reasonableness of an award of attorneys’\nfees for an abuse of discretion. Smith v. Phila. Hous. Auth.,\n107 F.3d 223, 225 (3d Cir. 1997). The party seeking\n11\nattorneys’ fees has the burden to prove that its request is\nreasonable. Rode v. Dellarciprete, 892 F.2d 1177, 1183 (3d\nCir. 1990). To meet its burden, the fee petitioner must\nsubmit evidence to support the hours and billing rates it\nclaims. Id. The School District argues that the following\nrates awarded were unreasonable and unsupported by the\nrecord: $200 per hour for Laputka, $150 per hour for\nLentowski, $150 per hour for Sernark-Martinelli, and $85\nper hour for paralegals.\nA reasonable hourly rate is calculated according to the\nprevailing market rates in the community. Washington v.\nPhila. County Court of Common Pleas, 89 F.3d 1031, 1035\n(3d Cir. 1996). An attorney’s usual billing rate is a good\nstarting point for assessing reasonableness, though it is not\ndispositive. Maldonado v. Houstoun, 256 F.3d 181, 184-85\n(3d Cir. 2001).\nLaputka and four other attorneys in the area performing\nthe same services submitted affidavits. Their rates ranged\nfrom $150 to $250 per hour. It was not an abuse of\ndiscretion to apply rates within this range for the three\nattorneys who worked on this case, regardless of whether\nthey were hired as contract lawyers or were relatively recent\nlaw school graduates. This is particularly true when the\nmore junior associates, Lentowski and Sernark-Martinelli,\nwere awarded the lowest rate within the range.\nWith regard to the paralegal rate of $85 per hour, the\nSchool District argues that pursuant to recent decisions on\nfee petitions that assessed paralegal rates at $50 per hour,\nthe District Court should have reduced the rate awarded in\nthe instant case. See, e.g., James v. Norton, 176 F. Supp.\n2d 385, 400 (E.D. Pa. 2001). However, in those cases the\nrates were reduced because it was deemed unnecessary to\nbill paralegals at senior paralegal rates when evidence\nshowed they engaged in low-level clerical work, such as\ntyping. Id. at 399-400. Laputka’s affidavit indicated that the\nparalegals involved in the instant case participated in a\nbroader and more complex range of trial-preparation\nactivities. The Court was free to accept Laputka’s affidavit\nin light of the School District’s failure to provide evidence in\nsupport of its objection. We will therefore uphold the\nreasonableness of the paralegal rate.\n12\nIII.\nIn conclusion, the record viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Potence supports the jury verdict, and the\nDistrict Court did not err as a matter of law in granting\nliquidated damages or abuse its discretion in calculating\nattorneys fees or refusing the requested special\ninterrogatory. We will therefore affirm.\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n13\n",,left,Normal,1,end row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
