Eventually, children will realize they have been used and that the parent really did not protect them or their childhood from adult problems.\n\nEven if you think your child can't hear you, know that she still experiences your upset before or after conflict with the other parent.

Give him the same amount of money each month and let him know you are counting on him to manage his money wisely for buying clothes, toys, and  entertainment. If the child has been given money in the past without helping out, it will be difficult but not impossible to get him to accept payment for helping out.\n\nYou don't want to be his maid or him to be your maid. Even if you can afford a maid, still ask him to help out so he knows he is a contributing member of society. It will serve your family to  talk about the value of working together. Having the right attitude towards work will go a long way towards setting an example for your children. If you hate work so will they.

The court needs to know how many disabled children were born to you or adopted by you during your marriage  because a disabled child has special needs and protected rights under the law.,,"In California, parental custody terminates when a child reaches 18, gets married (with parental permission), is emancipated or the court appoints a guardian. But in some cases, a court can order that a disabled child continue to receive support under the custody agreement afterwards.\n\nTo continue support in most states, the disability must have arisen before the child reached majority in order. Any case to establish the continuing duty of support past age 18 or high school must be started before the child reaches the age of majority. \n\nWhat about a child whose parents do not divorce until after he is 18 or finished high school? Some states take the position that all that is necessary is for the child to have had a disability prior to that time and then the parents must continue the support.\n\nBest to consult an attorney about this issue because it may require legal research, analysis and court action.\n",,"(California law is shown here.

Where a child, after attaining the age of majority, continues\nto serve and to be supported by the parent, neither party is\nentitled to compensation, in the absence of an agreement for the\ncompensation.\n\nCA Probate Code Section 1600.\nGuardianship automatically ends when one of the following happens to the child:\n\nTurns 18, \nIs adopted, \nGets married, \nIs emancipated (freed from guardianship) by court order, \nGoes into the military, or \nDies. \n\nOr the child, a parent, or the guardian can ask the court to end the guardianship. This is called ""terminating a guardianship.""

In the case of earthquake have a person outside your local area whom everyone calls to help direct everyone to a common location. It is best to have every one prepared in case of an emergency. Teaching a small child 911 may save their life or someone elses. Know your home escape routes and routinely have your children follow some sort of safety drill. You might consider having your family learn cpr and other first aid practices. If you are prepared and you teach your child to be aware of common dangers and how to react quickly you empower them to be vigilant about safety issues concerning the whole family and community.

A custodial guardian has responsibility for the child's physical care and a financial guardian has responsibility for the child's money; a guardian who is responsible for both the child and the child's finances is called a plenary guardian.\n\nIf you have chosen someone to be custodial guardian but are concerned about his ability to manage the financial aspects of the child's life, then choose a separate person for that responsibility.",,,,,0,,Guardian,,,,,,,,,

In determining\nthe best interest of the child, the preference for frequent and\ncontinuing contact with both parents, as set forth in subdivision (b)\nof Section 3020, or with the noncustodial parent, as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 3040, may not be used to\nrebut the presumption, in whole or in part.\n   (2) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a batterer'\ns treatment program that meets the criteria outlined in subdivision\n(c) of Section 1203.097 of the Penal Code.\n   (3) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a program\nof alcohol or drug abuse counseling if the court determines that\ncounseling is appropriate.\n   (4) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a parenting\nclass if the court determines the class to be appropriate.\n   (5) Whether the perpetrator is on probation or parole, and whether\nhe or she has complied with the terms and conditions of probation or\nparole.\n   (6) Whether the perpetrator is restrained by a protective order or\nrestraining order, and whether he or she has complied with its terms\nand conditions.\n   (7) Whether the perpetrator of domestic violence has committed any\nfurther acts of domestic violence.\n   (c) For purposes of this section, a person has ""perpetrated\ndomestic violence"" when he or she is found by the court to have\nintentionally or recklessly caused or attempted to cause bodily\ninjury, or sexual assault, or to have placed a person in reasonable\napprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to\nanother, or to have engaged in any behavior involving, but not\nlimited to, threatening, striking, harassing, destroying personal\nproperty or disturbing the peace of another, for which a court may\nissue an ex parte order pursuant to Section 6320 to protect the other\nparty seeking custody of the child or to protect the child and the\nchild's siblings.\n   (d) (1) For purposes of this section, the requirement of a finding\nby the court shall be satisfied by, among other things, and not\nlimited to, evidence that a party seeking custody has been convicted\nwithin the previous five years, after a trial or a plea of guilty or\nno contest, of any crime against the other party that comes within\nthe definition of domestic violence contained in Section 6211 and of\nabuse contained in Section 6203, including, but not limited to, a\ncrime described in subdivision (e) of Section 243 of, or Section 261,\n262, 273.5, 422, or 646.9 of, the Penal Code.\n   (2)  The requirement of a finding by the court shall also be\nsatisfied if any court, whether that court hears or has heard the\nchild custody proceedings or not, has made a finding pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) based on conduct occurring within the previous five\nyears.\n   (e) When a court makes a finding that a party has perpetrated\ndomestic violence, the court may not base its findings solely on\nconclusions reached by a child custody evaluator or on the\nrecommendation of the Family Court Services staff, but shall consider\nany relevant, admissible evidence submitted by the parties.\n   (f) In any custody or restraining order proceeding in which a\nparty has alleged that the other party has perpetrated domestic\nviolence in accordance with the terms of this section, the court\nshall inform the parties of the existence of this section and shall\ngive them a copy of this section prior to any custody mediation in\nthe case.\n",,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

1722,97,Custody,SafeBehaviors,driving,When should vPlanChildrenNames be allowed to drive a car?,,Driving age,,,,multicheck,0,text,,,,1925-08-29 23:10:19,,,,"Without a doubt, one of the scariest times for a parent is when their child learns to drive. Thoughtful parents try everything to ensure that your child is a safe driver and safe with another adolescent driver. Check different driver schools, driver safety websites and high school programs to determine the best way to teach driving and safety. \n\nTalk with your state highway patrol about where to view cars involved in fatal accidents and take your child there to see them. Almost everyone knows someone who lost a loved one or friend in a car accident. Have your child talk with that adult to hear what it means to lose someone that way. Many police departments offer a Ã¢â‚¬Å“ride alongÃ¢â‚¬Â program to take teenagers on rides during patrol. Be creative!!!\n\nChildren must understand that driving a car is like wielding a loaded gun and perhaps even more dangerous because others on the road can harm or kill you. A parent must do everything possible to protect the child then let go and pray that she will not be one of the 6,000 teenagers (27 % alcohol related) or 40,000 people killed by cars each year in the U.S. see, http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov and http://www.hwysafety.org/safety_facts/fatality_facts/teens.htm \n\nHere are some good rules of thumb. First, a car should be a very safe car, whether old or new. Second, drinking or drugs or other activities that impair perception or ability to drive should be forbidden, subject to denial of driving until 18 because that is the punishment most state law will impose. Remind them that drug and alcohol testing kits are available and if it comes to that, you will suspend their driving privileges before the police. If your state does not have rules about driving and cell phone use, loud music and the number of passenger in the car, consider imposing these conditions for at least six months to one year. \n\nLetting your child get behind the wheel will take some deep breathing and patience. Be consistent about enforcing your rules and also remember you were once in the same situation, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t impose rules that are not fair just because your own parents did so. Rules do matter when it comes to driving so the first rule is to teach your child to drive defensively by you own driving is the best way to avoid or limit risk and injury that comes with driving.\n\n",,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

If both parents are open and smart enough to view the world from the perspective of the other parent, you will be able to reach common agreement leading to real collaboration. Remember that you can best be a peacemaker when you are truly at peace with yourself and that your children will model your behavior, good or bad.\n\nA parent may want peace at any cost, but not realize the ""real"" cost is too expensive until it is too late. If you hide negative feelings about a situation because you have always believed that everything would go more smoothly to just ""go along,"" you may be causing bigger problems for you and your family. \n\nIf you do not allow yourself to feel the loss when relationships change or end, however harmful it may be, you may be missing a great opportunity for significant personal improvement and growth. Pay careful attention when you experience too much or too little feeling about a conflict because it may indicate you may be ignoring your true feelings. \n\nShowing your true face and true feelings would honor your honest experience. Expressing yourself without being mean or harmful, even if those feelings are anger or frustration, will help in many ways. Using this opportunity to explore personal issues and express your honest feelings, you encourage others involved to do the same. \n\nTaking responsiblity for your feelings In the safe environment of therapy could help create an authentic collaborative relationship with the other parent. There are many forms of self-inquiry and many types of services available, from traditional therapy to church counseling. You may even have a wise friend or relative you would trust when talking about your negative feelings. To be most helpful, share your feelings with a safe and objective listener who will not criticize or judge you, the other parent or your situation. \n\n\n",,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

The court needs to know how many disabled children were born to you or adopted by you during your marriage  because a disabled child has special needs and protected rights under the law.,,"In California, parental custody terminates when a child reaches 18, gets married (with parental permission), is emancipated or the court appoints a guardian. But in some cases, a court can order that a disabled child continue to receive support under the custody agreement afterwards.\n\nTo continue support in most states, the disability must have arisen before the child reached majority in order. Any case to establish the continuing duty of support past age 18 or high school must be started before the child reaches the age of majority. \n\nWhat about a child whose parents do not divorce until after he is 18 or finished high school? Some states take the position that all that is necessary is for the child to have had a disability prior to that time and then the parents must continue the support.\n\nBest to consult an attorney about this issue because it may require legal research, analysis and court action.\n",,"(California law is shown here. Your state's law may be different.)\n\nCA Family Code Section 7505.  \nThe authority of a parent ceases on any of the following:\n   (a) The appointment, by a court, of a guardian of the person of\nthe child.\n   (b) The marriage of the child.\n   (c) The child attaining the age of majority.\n\n7506.  Where a child, after attaining the age of majority, continues\nto serve and to be supported by the parent, neither party is\nentitled to compensation, in the absence of an agreement for the\ncompensation.\n\nCA Probate Code Section 1600.\nGuardianship automatically ends when one of the following happens to the child:\n\nTurns 18, \nIs adopted, \nGets married, \nIs emancipated (freed from guardianship) by court order, \nGoes into the military, or \nDies. \n\nOr the child, a parent, or the guardian can ask the court to end the guardianship. This is called ""terminating a guardianship."" You must prove that the guardianship isn't necessary anymore or that ending the guardianship is the best thing for the child.\n\nUntil custody or guardianship is terminated, the parents have a legal responsibility to provide for the child food, shelter, education and healthcare.\n\n\nCalifornia request for termination of guardianship form, GC-255, to be completed and filed by custodial parents.\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/fillable/gc255.pdf\n\nCalifornia order granting termination of guardianship form, GC-260, to be completed by custodial parents and signed by the judge.\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/fillable/gc260.pdf",,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

When the child repeatedly hears the stories or is told about new ""bad things."" the other parent did, the child begins to wonder if the stories just may be true. The alienation is complete when the alienating parent convinces the child that the other parent really is a bad guy who should be rejected and in response the child pulls back his emotional and physical connection from the other parent. As children, we hear and adopt the characteristics (feelings, beliefs, attitudes and opinions) from each parent so with alienation the child rejects the characteristics of the alienated parent.\n\nThe alienating parent uses manipulation to twist the facts, often playing the victim to the child. She may make false claims or say bad things about the other parent to the child. Clever manipulation often comes in the form of a half-truth, where a small part of what was claimed is true and most of the claim is not true. For example, she may say ""Your father is a failure, can't even keep his job."" This claim is based upon the fact that he lost his job but in reality he has worked his whole adult life and will get another job soon.\n\nHer goal is to punish the other parent by turning the child against him and achieve through lies what could not be achieved through the courts: to restrict or eliminate the role of the other parent in the child's life. Sadly, the motive is usually revenge or to gain the upper hand but could also be the result of depression or a negotiating tactic to gain a financial advantage.\n\nSome common justifications used to encourage rejection of the other parent include: ""he caused the split-up"" or ""he has deserted us"" or ""he will in harm you and should stay away to keep you safe."" The parent brainwashing the child has much more success when that parent is the primary custodial parent with whom the child spends most time. ",,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This presumption may only be rebutted by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.\n   (b) In determining whether the presumption set forth in\nsubdivision (a) has been overcome, the court shall consider all of\nthe following factors:\n   (1) Whether the perpetrator of domestic violence has demonstrated\nthat giving sole or joint physical or legal custody of a child to the\nperpetrator is in the best interest of the child.  In determining\nthe best interest of the child, the preference for frequent and\ncontinuing contact with both parents, as set forth in subdivision (b)\nof Section 3020, or with the noncustodial parent, as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 3040, may not be used to\nrebut the presumption, in whole or in part.\n   (2) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a batterer'\ns treatment program that meets the criteria outlined in subdivision\n(c) of Section 1203.097 of the Penal Code.\n   (3) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a program\nof alcohol or drug abuse counseling if the court determines that\ncounseling is appropriate.\n   (4) Whether the perpetrator has successfully completed a parenting\nclass if the court determines the class to be appropriate.\n   (5) Whether the perpetrator is on probation or parole, and whether\nhe or she has complied with the terms and conditions of probation or\nparole.\n   (6) Whether the perpetrator is restrained by a protective order or\nrestraining order, and whether he or she has complied with its terms\nand conditions.\n   (7) Whether the perpetrator of domestic violence has committed any\nfurther acts of domestic violence.\n   (c) For purposes of this section, a person has ""perpetrated\ndomestic violence"" when he or she is found by the court to have\nintentionally or recklessly caused or attempted to cause bodily\ninjury, or sexual assault, or to have placed a person in reasonable\napprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to that person or to\nanother, or to have engaged in any behavior involving, but not\nlimited to, threatening, striking, harassing, destroying personal\nproperty or disturbing the peace of another, for which a court may\nissue an ex parte order pursuant to Section 6320 to protect the other\nparty seeking custody of the child or to protect the child and the\nchild's siblings.\n   (d) (1) For purposes of this section, the requirement of a finding\nby the court shall be satisfied by, among other things, and not\nlimited to, evidence that a party seeking custody has been convicted\nwithin the previous five years, after a trial or a plea of guilty or\nno contest, of any crime against the other party that comes within\nthe definition of domestic violence contained in Section 6211 and of\nabuse contained in Section 6203, including, but not limited to, a\ncrime described in subdivision (e) of Section 243 of, or Section 261,\n262, 273.5, 422, or 646.9 of, the Penal Code.\n   (2)  The requirement of a finding by the court shall also be\nsatisfied if any court, whether that court hears or has heard the\nchild custody proceedings or not, has made a finding pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) based on conduct occurring within the previous five\nyears.\n   (e) When a court makes a finding that a party has perpetrated\ndomestic violence, the court may not base its findings solely on\nconclusions reached by a child custody evaluator or on the\nrecommendation of the Family Court Services staff, but shall consider\nany relevant, admissible evidence submitted by the parties.\n   (f) In any custody or restraining order proceeding in which a\nparty has alleged that the other party has perpetrated domestic\nviolence in accordance with the terms of this section, the court\nshall inform the parties of the existence of this section and shall\ngive them a copy of this section prior to any custody mediation in\nthe case.\n",,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

950,8,Custody,Agreeing,punishmentType,What are the consequences for vPlanChildrenNames not behaving?,,Misbehavior consequences,,,,multicheck,0,text,,,,2004-09-12 20:20:36,,,,"Spanking, hitting and other physical punishment sends the wrong message to children. It tells them that violence is an appropriate way of control and encourages them to hit other children or, other adults when older. \n\nWhen your child has done something wrong you will need to restate to the child what happened and what was the problem. As you make this statement, include the better behavior as an example. By doing this, both you and the child will be clear about what disappoints you and how to do it right next time. For instance, ""When you hit Mike it hurts him. I want you to stop."" Then say, ""I can see that you are angry. Please tell me why you are angry."" \n\nYou can then offer a pillow for the child to hit, telling them that it is good to express their anger but not to hit or hurt another with it. By finding out why your child is angry or rebellious will help you find a way to correct their behaviour. Most acting out is a child's primative attempt to get attention for feelings for which they do not have the words. \n\nIf this acting out is disruptive to you and your family, you may have to use a ""time-out."" Give the child a safe place to calm down, once calmed down make another attempt at finding out why your child is unhappy or resistant. Making the effort to question a negative behavior is the best way to know how to repair it. \n\nChildren need structure and limits to learn respect.  If you allow your child to disrespect your's or another boundaries, you contribute to your child's anti-social behavior. If you feel you have no right to be treated with respect, your child will think that using disrespectful language and actions are acceptable. If you personally use disrepectful language and actions, you teach your child that these are acceptable ways to treat others. \n\nYou will need to model for them how you want them to be respectful and responsible. If you don't, it is useless to punish them for what you won't do. Ask yourself, ""Has punishment ever changed behavior in the long run?"" Then ask, ""What has made a positive difference?"" \n\nReinforcing good behavior is a more effective way of getting positive results. Punishment may just be another way of passing your frustrated feeling onto the child. As a parent, you are the most important and powerful person in the eyes of your child so your disappoinment in what they did wrong should be punishment enough.  \n\nRestating the acceptable limits and then making a new agreement for better behavior may be all that is needed. If you start this practice when your child is young, you have a better chance at not developing bad habits in communication. Now that there is a change in the family arrangement you can establish for your family a new practice of behavior based upon respect.

The alienation is complete when the alienating parent convinces the child that the other parent really is a bad guy who should be rejected and in response the child pulls back his emotional and physical connection from the other parent. As children, we hear and adopt the characteristics (feelings, beliefs, attitudes and opinions) from each parent so with alienation the child rejects the characteristics of the alienated parent.\n\nThe alienating parent uses manipulation to twist the facts, often playing the victim to the child. She may make false claims or say bad things about the other parent to the child. Clever manipulation often comes in the form of a half-truth, where a small part of what was claimed is true and most of the claim is not true. For example, she may say ""Your father is a failure, can't even keep his job."" This claim is based upon the fact that he lost his job but in reality he has worked his whole adult life and will get another job soon.\n\nHer goal is to punish the other parent by turning the child against him and achieve through lies what could not be achieved through the courts: to restrict or eliminate the role of the other parent in the child's life. Sadly, the motive is usually revenge or to gain the upper hand but could also be the result of depression or a negotiating tactic to gain a financial advantage.\n\nSome common justifications used to encourage rejection of the other parent include: ""he caused the split-up"" or ""he has deserted us"" or ""he will in harm you and should stay away to keep you safe.""

Also know this is a natural occurence and does not mean she does not love you or does not wish to be with you. On the contrary, it is because she trusts you that she is willing to talk about this new phase in her life, feeling comfortable sharing her own concerns and desires. If you make it impossible for her to separate because you are unwilling to let go because of your trust or control issues, she may rebel against you with deceit and alienation.\n\nWhen considering an appropriate age for dating or when to allow the use of makeup, you may wish to consider several factors. First, the most important factor is the emotional maturity of the child. Second, consider the age range for dating or make-up followed by your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peer group and their families. Last but not least is the dating age that is most comfortable for you because your opinion matters. \n\nWhatever your decision, if you deliver the message with love, kindness, and logic, even if she disagrees with your decision she should respect it. Absolutes or hard and fast positions are difficult to change without losing face, so always leave the door open with a truthful promise to review the situation in a few months. On some occasions you may wish to raise the issue instead of waiting for her, in this way she will know that you were sincere in your promise for a review.\n\nA good way for your child to enter dating life may be by meeting a date at school dances or double or triple dating with friends or older siblings. You can remove some of your concerns by setting limits like curfews and insisting on phone numbers for destinations, a plan for making contact when you want to connect. \n\nConsider a simple contract that is signed by the child and both parents, listing agreements such as no alcohol or drugs, curfew time, safe drivers, off-limit places or activities, etc. While it may seem too rigid or formal, having the child sign on the dotted line tends to make people take agreements more seriously than a verbal Ã¢â‚¬Å“sure, I agree.Ã¢â‚¬Â Remember to keep an open-minded and that kids will make mistakes.  You can be both encouraging and still set appropriate limits.\n\nIt makes sense to have a plan for picking her up should she find herself be in a difficult or compromising situation, like where alcohol and drugs are involved. Let her know that if she calls there will be complaints, punishment or negative comments, on the contrary it would be an opportunity for praise and positive reinforcement for using common sense and following agreements.\n\nIf you express a positive interest in all aspects of your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, such as music, clothing, friends and popular trends, you will remain a trusted confident and friend for life. If you know her friends and what they are exploring, you will know how to help her navigate through these very difficult years. The more open and knowledgeable you are about her friends and life at school, the easier it will be to openly discuss her concerns, challenges and choices when they arise.\n\nThere are many problems that can be avoided if parents and children establish an honest and respectful dialogue with each other. You can be her friend and her parent, because bluring the line of authority and structure can have disastrous effects. Strike a balance between being open-minded and knowing in your heart and mind what is best for her. Too many Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â or too few Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â will make dating and growing up a nightmare for her and the rest of the family. \n\n",,,,,,,0,,Dating - Child,,,,,,,,,

It is a well known fact that when behaviors are severely restricted, the desire for those behaviors increases and become secretive or even defiant. \n\nConsider asking your child his opinion about the right age and amount to engage in such activities. Doing so will give the whole family a place to start a dialogue about social drinking, smoking or dancing. If you veto the whole discussion with a rule justified by your fears or beliefs, you will not create a safe place where these subjects can be openly and honestly discussed. \n\nThe more a child is allowed to be responsible for his own life and given the ability to make decisions, the better he will protect himself when danger appears and nobody is around to advise him. Consider providing him with examples and test situations so he can make up his own mind as to what is healthy and constructive and what is not. He needs to know his actions affect more than himself, just as your actions affect more then just you. \n\nThis is a great time to reinforce that the family is a team and that teammates look after one other.

Loss from divorce is a particularly vulnerable place for children because if their physical and emotional needs are neglected, they are prey to others who advantage these needs and desires. When there are age differences, this play can be a form of molestation, which may have the result in affecting a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life with sexual confusion and low self-esteem. \n\nThe best way to address these concerns is to ask your self whether your child is getting her attention and affection needs met. It may also be necessary to tell your child what is appropriate behavior so they know where they need to set limits. If you have older children, speaking to them or having some else whom they trust explain what appropriate behavior is will help them to respect the boundaries of others (particularly a younger child). Unconscious aggressions and compulsions can be acted out sexually. \n\nThese acts of violation can mean a lifetime of suffering for both the victim and the perpetrator. In loss there is grief and this grief if not attended to can become a symptom which needs self-medicating.  The painful circumstances of divorce or separation (loss) can drive a child to sibling incest or even self-mutilation in the form of cutting and burning.  Other symptoms of an unaddressed emotional pain might include obsessive masturbation and autoerotism. \n\nThese behaviors can be addressed and healed if everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grief in the family is met with loving kindness and forgiveness. Vigilance is the necessary watchdog when it comes to loss. By being aware of what your children are doing, you minimize the threat of violation. If you suspect violating behaviors take immediate action and get the necessary therapy to resolve your familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problem. It is never to late to address and heal destructive behaviors.

If you are respectful and sensitive in the manner you address your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preference, your child will feel safe and open with you. He may not even be aware of his choice nor may not be ready to bring the subject into a conversation. If the later is the case, your attitude of total acceptance around any choice may well be the best attitude to adopt.\n\nWhether or not you are comfortable with his same sex preference, consider contacting groups that provide guidance and unbiased information. Consider researching the Internet for organizations and pertinent literature to expand your knowledge on this subject.  \n\nWhen dealing with sex education topics, it is a good idea to include all configurations of partnership. There are many good books on the subject and you can create for your child an atmosphere of safety and openness if you yourself are willing to explore non-traditional relationships.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with his same sex preference, you may want to reexamine your own priorities. Is it more important that your child reflect the values of a heterosexual society or that they are happy with themselves and the partners they choose. Would you rather have a relationship of honesty and love with your child or risk a lifetime of estrangement. The best thing you can do is explore you own value system, judgments and fears.  \n\nOnce you get past your opinions and your biases, you will be able to have open dialogue with your child. In many cases where children believe their parents will never accept homosexuality, they keep their love relationships a secret. After dealing with the disruption of the family caused by divorce, wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be best to have a whole family no matter what the differences. Alternative family and alternative love should be a reason to embrace and accept every kind or choice.\n",,,,,,,0,,Sexual Orientation,,,,,,,,,

Also know this is a natural occurence and does not mean she does not love you or does not wish to be with you. On the contrary, it is because she trusts you that she is willing to talk about this new phase in her life, feeling comfortable sharing her own concerns and desires. If you make it impossible for her to separate because you are unwilling to let go because of your trust or control issues, she may rebel against you with deceit and alienation.\n\nWhen considering an appropriate age for dating or when to allow the use of makeup, you may wish to consider several factors. First, the most important factor is the emotional maturity of the child. Second, consider the age range for dating or make-up followed by your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peer group and their families. Last but not least is the dating age that is most comfortable for you because your opinion matters. \n\nWhatever your decision, if you deliver the message with love, kindness, and logic, even if she disagrees with your decision she should respect it. Absolutes or hard and fast positions are difficult to change without losing face, so always leave the door open with a truthful promise to review the situation in a few months. On some occasions you may wish to raise the issue instead of waiting for her, in this way she will know that you were sincere in your promise for a review.\n\nA good way for your child to enter dating life may be by meeting a date at school dances or double or triple dating with friends or older siblings. You can remove some of your concerns by setting limits like curfews and insisting on phone numbers for destinations, a plan for making contact when you want to connect. \n\nConsider a simple contract that is signed by the child and both parents, listing agreements such as no alcohol or drugs, curfew time, safe drivers, off-limit places or activities, etc. While it may seem too rigid or formal, having the child sign on the dotted line tends to make people take agreements more seriously than a verbal Ã¢â‚¬Å“sure, I agree.Ã¢â‚¬Â Remember to keep an open-minded and that kids will make mistakes.  You can be both encouraging and still set appropriate limits.\n\nIt makes sense to have a plan for picking her up should she find herself be in a difficult or compromising situation, like where alcohol and drugs are involved. Let her know that if she calls there will be complaints, punishment or negative comments, on the contrary it would be an opportunity for praise and positive reinforcement for using common sense and following agreements.\n\nIf you express a positive interest in all aspects of your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, such as music, clothing, friends and popular trends, you will remain a trusted confident and friend for life. If you know her friends and what they are exploring, you will know how to help her navigate through these very difficult years. The more open and knowledgeable you are about her friends and life at school, the easier it will be to openly discuss her concerns, challenges and choices when they arise.\n\nThere are many problems that can be avoided if parents and children establish an honest and respectful dialogue with each other. You can be her friend and her parent, because bluring the line of authority and structure can have disastrous effects. Strike a balance between being open-minded and knowing in your heart and mind what is best for her. Too many Ã¢â‚¬Å“noÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â or too few Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â will make dating and growing up a nightmare for her and the rest of the family. \n\n",,,,,,,0,,Sex Education,,,,,,,,,

Consider researching the Internet for organizations and pertinent literature to expand your knowledge on this subject.  \n\nWhen dealing with sex education topics, it is a good idea to include all configurations of partnership. There are many good books on the subject and you can create for your child an atmosphere of safety and openness if you yourself are willing to explore non-traditional relationships.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with his same sex preference, you may want to reexamine your own priorities. Is it more important that your child reflect the values of a heterosexual society or that they are happy with themselves and the partners they choose. Would you rather have a relationship of honesty and love with your child or risk a lifetime of estrangement. The best thing you can do is explore you own value system, judgments and fears.  \n\nOnce you get past your opinions and your biases, you will be able to have open dialogue with your child. In many cases where children believe their parents will never accept homosexuality, they keep their love relationships a secret. After dealing with the disruption of the family caused by divorce, wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be best to have a whole family no matter what the differences. Alternative family and alternative love should be a reason to embrace and accept every kind or choice.\n",,,,,,,0,,Sexual Orientation,,,,,,,,,

Violence and pornography are difficult subjects even for consenting adults to comprehend and process. You could steal your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood by giving them access to a world beyond his emotional maturity. Too much, too soon can create anxiety and abberant behaviors. \n\nTo relieve anxiety, a child may choose to desensitize or become addicted to an exaggerated emotional reaction and accompanied behaviors. Look at your child and ask yourself what they know about in the world. If her world is still centered around her mother, a movie like Bambi can be too violent. \n\nThe other side of this coin is to overprotect and not expose your child to some of the realities of the world. A over protected person may feel that they cannot engage in the world or they may feel overly concerned with saving it.  Either way you have the ability to know what your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maturity level is by engaging them in honest dialog, which fits their level of understanding. This level should match what they are exposed to if you do not know your child, you will not know what is appropriate. If you cannot have an open dialog with your child about the resources they are exposed to they are too young!\n\nAsk older children how they feel and think about these images and behaviors being so available to anyone, including children younger than themselves.  If you have facts and logic to support your opinion, an interesting discussion may well develop and lead to openness, trust and respect instead of secrecy, mistrust and disrespect. \n\nThe best way to protect your children in this media-centered world is to allow them to think for themselves and have the freedom of choice to decide what is appropriate, to the extent they can be responsible. If your children share your own values, you can trust they will self-censor by limiting what is presented to them without your constant review and protection.

A private life includes thoughts, feelings and actions each individual cherishes as one's own. A boundary is a self-imposed limitation on sharing those thoughts, feelings or actions with others.\n\nEvery person has free choice when it comes to sharing oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private life and lowering boundaries with others, including one's own parents. While some parents take the position that, ""as long as my child is living in my home there will be no secrets,"" such an attitude creates more secrecy on the part of the child.Perhaps their own parents treated them in a similar way and now feel they have the power and the right to know about everything about their child's life. Mental health experts agree that children need a private life so they can grow into an adult who is not dependent on the parent or others.\n\nBy respecting your childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s privacy you honor her personal boundary and individuality. If on the other hand, you do not give your privacy, you send the message that anyone can invade even their most sacred space--their privacy. A child who is constantly invaded may 1) become personally overwhelmed or 2) may invade other children's limits or 3) may create a double life, protected by deceits, deceptions and lies. A child with privacy and a private world will approach others with respect and trust, interacting privately and publicly with an open heart.  \n\nIf you want your child to be trustworthy you need to trust them. It is far better to create a safe space within a relationship where your child is comfortable telling you about something that might cause harm to herself or others.  A suspicious attitude on your part may drive your child into deeper secrecy. Your suspicions sends the message she is bad and wrong, whereas openness and lack of judgment welcomes an honest and open exchange between you and your child.

They are\nalert to signs like these that may signal the presence of child abuse.\nThe Child:\n·  Shows sudden changes in behavior or school performance;\n·  Has not received help for physical or medical problems brought to the parents' attention;\n·  Has learning problems that cannot be attributed to specific physical or psychological\ncauses;\n·  Is always watchful, as though preparing for something bad to happen;\n·  Lacks adult supervision;\n·  Is overly compliant, an overachiever, or too responsible; or\n·  Comes to school early, stays late, and does not want to go home.\n\nThe Parent:\n·  Shows little concern for the child, rarely responding to the school's requests for\ninformation, for conferences, or for home visits;\n·  Denies the existence of -- or blames the child for -- the child's problems in school or at\nhome;\n·  Asks the classroom teacher to use harsh physical discipline if the child misbehaves;\n·  Sees the child entirely bad, worthless, or burdensome;\n·  Demands perfection or a level of physical or academic performance the child cannot\nachieve; or\n·  Looks primarily to the child for care, attention, and satisfaction of emotional needs.\n\nThe Parent and Child:\n·  Rarely touch or look at each other;\n·  Consider their relationship entirely negative; or\n·  State that they do not like each other.\n·  None of these signs proves that child abuse is present in a family. Any of them may be\nfound in any parent or child at one time or another. But when these signs appear\nrepeatedly or in combination, they should cause the educator to take closer look at the\nsituation and to consider the possibility of child abuse. That second look may reveal\nfurther signs of abuse or signs of a particular kind of child abuse.\n\nSIGNS OF SEXUAL ABUSE\nConsider the possibility of sexual abuse when the child:\n·  Has difficulty walking or sitting;\n·  Suddenly refuses to change for gym or to participate in physical activities;\n·  Demonstrates bizarre, sophisticated, or unusual sexual knowledge or behavior;\n·  Becomes pregnant or contracts a venereal disease, particularly if under age fourteen;\n·  Runs away; or\n·  Reports sexual abuse by a parent or another adult caregiver.\nConsider the possibility of sexual abuse when the parent or other adult caregiver:\n·  Is unduly protective of the child, severely limits the child's contact with other children,\nespecially of the opposite sex;\n·  Is secretive and isolated; or\n·  Describes marital difficulties involving family power struggles or sexual relations.\n\nSIGNS OF PHYSICAL ABUSE\nConsider the possibility of physical abuse when the child:\n·  Has unexplained burns, bites, bruises, broken bones, or black eyes;\n·  Has fading bruises or other marks noticeable after an absence from school;\n·  Seems frightened of the parents and protests or cries when it is time to go home from\nschool;\n·  Shrinks at the approach of adults; or\n·  Reports injury by a parent or another adult caregiver.\nConsider the possibility of physical abuse when the parent or other adult caregiver:\n·  Offers conflicting, unconvincing, or no explanation for the child's injury;\n·  Describes the child as ""evil,"" or in some other very negative way;\n·  Uses harsh physical discipline with the child; or\n·  Has a history of abuse as a child.\n\nEMOTIONAL ABUSE\nEmotional child abuse is maltreatment which results in impaired psychological growth and development. It involves words, actions, and indifference. Abusers constantly reject, ignore, belittle, dominate, and criticize the victims. This form of abuse may occur with or without physical abuse, but there is often an overlap.\n\nExamples of emotional child abuse are verbal abuse; excessive demands on a child’s performance; penalizing a child for positive, normal behavior (smiling, mobility, exploration, vocalization, manipulation of objects); discouraging caregiver and infant attachment; penalizing a child for demonstrating signs of positive self-esteem; and penalizing a child for using interpersonal skills needed for adequate performance in school and peer groups. In addition, frequently exposing children to family violence and unwillingness or inability to provide\naffection.\n\nSIGNS OF EMOTIONAL ABUSE\nConsider the possibility of emotional abuse when the child:\n·  Shows extremes in behavior, such as overly compliant or demanding behavior, extreme\npassivity or aggression;\n·  Is either inappropriately adult (parenting other children, for example) or inappropriately\ninfantile (frequently rocking or head-banging, for example);\n·  Is delayed in physical or emotional development;\n·  Has attempted suicide; or\n·  Reports a lack of attachment to the parent.\n\nConsider the possibility of emotional maltreatment when the parent or other adult caregiver:\n·  Constantly blames, belittles, or berates the child;\n·  Is unconcerned about the child and refuses to consider offers of help for the child's school\nproblems; or\n·  Overtly rejects the child.\n\nSIGNS OF NEGLECT\nConsider the possibility of neglect when the child:\n·  Is frequently absent from school;\n·  Begs or steals food or money from classmates;\n·  Lacks needed medical or dental care, immunizations, or glasses;\n·  Is consistently dirty and has severe body odor;\n·  Lacks sufficient clothing for the weather;\n·  Abuses alcohol or other drugs; or\n·  States there is no one at home to provide care.\n\nConsider the possibility of neglect when the parent or other adult caregiver:\n·  Appears to be indifferent to the child;\n·  Seems apathetic or depressed;\n·  Behaves irrationally or in a bizarre manner; or\n·  Is abusing alcohol or other drugs.",,,,,,,0,,Child Abuse; Abuse - Child History,,,,,,,,,

If so, list that disability.",,,,,,radio,0,text,child,,,2004-03-22 12:16:12,,,"Necesidades especiales incluyen a niños con problemas físicos, emocionales o mentales que requieran consideración especial o educación especial.","When a special needs parent has unresolved feelings about their responsibility for causing or curing or caring, their behavior may show sign of guilt, extreme protectiveness or lack of protection. To help resolve these feelings parents and perhaps children may benefit from therapy. When a parent who feels guilty shares responsibility, he or she may feel both threatened and depressed and especially when the behavior of the care giving parent is called into question. When one parent attempts to control care of the child to the exclusion of the other parent, this may mean a profound need by the care giving parent to make up for the tragic event that resulted in some kind of physical or mental disability.\n\nIf the parent has very little self esteem or meaning in life, the needs of the child may give meaning to an otherwise unfulfilled life. If the child is being held back because of these underlying feelings, the parent should be encouraged to receive counseling and parenting education to develop a strong ""self"" so the child is not harmed.  Self development may include reading, scheduled days off, exercise, diet and possibly a support group where parents in similar situations can share experiences, ideas, support and wisdom.\n\nAnother symptom of this guilt might be an overt rejection of the special needs child, where the parent gives up any sort of responsibility, affection or concern. It would be difficult but not impossible to convince a parent with this attitude to become responsible for the child without the help of counseling. Since the parent may feel shameful of the child and may not admit fear or even dislike of the child, it may be wise to limit time with the child until this situation improves.  Acceptance, understanding and kindness are the best ways to heal the parent so that the child will have two loving parents.\n\nHow the child become disabled may be important, for instance if a disability was caused by a hereditary defect of the father or by the mother's behavior during pregnancy such as drugs or drinking. Depending on the cause, one or both parent might be too protective of the child, such as always worrying about or watching the child or preventing the child to play with others in a normal activity like rollerblading or football.\n\nOther ways problems associated with a disabled child may include behaviors like not maintaining herself or ignoring family or work duties. There might also be a lack of self care and even self destructive attitudes and possible addictive behaviors such as alcohol, drugs (legal and illegal), food (gorging, binging, anorexia) or other issues.\n\n",,The judge will want to know that both parents have a voice and a vote when determining how to assist their child who has special needs. Judges favor joint decision making even if one parent is more familiar with the needs of the child. If one parent is a teacher or a health care provider who has relevant experience with other similar situations the judge should be made aware of this fact.\n,"El juez querrá saber que ambos padres tiene voz y voto en cuanto a determinar cómo ayudar a su hijo con necesidades especiales. Los jueces favorecen el tomar las decisiones compartidas, aún si uno de los padres es el que está más familiarizado con las necesidades del niño. Si uno de los padres es maestro o es un provedor de asistencia sanitaria con experiencia reelevante en otras situaciones similares, se le debe dar a conocer este hecho al juez.",,,,0,,Disability - Child,,,,,,,,,

Many great athletes became great because of their hardship. Children need dreams and heros, so find a way to give your child a shot at being a hero.\n\nThe sports parent contact should have enough spare time to be there for younger children who need lots of time and attention. Shopping for uniforms and equipment is the first time committment but shuttling to/from practices, games and special events can be very time consuming. Consider being a team parent who brings water, refreshments and snacks for practices and games.\n\nSports activities are great for teaching discipline and teamwork, while vastly improving your child's self-esteem and self-confidence.  If the right sport is chosen for her ability and focus, everything associated with that sport can be worked out so the whole family can benefit from her experience. If you as the sports parent contact are not familiar with the sport, talk with the coach about your child's ability and focus to determine the right fit.\n\nHere is another important place of agreement around the issues of safety, finances and time involvement. If one parent does not have the time, money or feels concerned about injury, both must be willing to agree to agree.

Be careful you do not agree to more than one or two activities because that may be a setup for unnecessary stress, disappointment and failure.  \n\nAs the contact parent, you could be very busy shuttling from school to activity, especially if you have more than one child.

For younger children, consider having a family discussion around the activity but parents should have the final word since their time and money are involved.\n\nThe younger the child the less understanding she will have about the value of money. Likewise, younger children are not the best judge of time so they may want too many activities based on time available after school or other obligations like homework or chores. Before you say yes to an activity, find out what is involved. \n\nThe contact parent should weigh benefits to the child versus the negatives of spending your time, energy and money. If a balanced schedule is chosen, you will not end up resenting your child for taking all your time and your child will not end up disapointed. Don't forget that children need individual play time and quiet time to wind down, so include that time in the schedule.\n\nIf you do not have the funds for some of these activities, research scholarships from your church or business clubs like Rotary, Lions or Kiwanis and when you get a ""no"" ask them for other places to check.

To help resolve these feelings parents and perhaps children may benefit from therapy. When a parent who feels guilty shares responsibility, he or she may feel both threatened and depressed and especially when the behavior of the care giving parent is called into question. When one parent attempts to control care of the child to the exclusion of the other parent, this may mean a profound need by the care giving parent to make up for the tragic event that resulted in some kind of physical or mental disability.\n\nIf the parent has very little self esteem or meaning in life, the needs of the child may give meaning to an otherwise unfulfilled life. If the child is being held back because of these underlying feelings, the parent should be encouraged to receive counseling and parenting education to develop a strong ""self"" so the child is not harmed.  Self development may include reading, scheduled days off, exercise, diet and possibly a support group where parents in similar situations can share experiences, ideas, support and wisdom.\n\nAnother symptom of this guilt might be an overt rejection of the special needs child, where the parent gives up any sort of responsibility, affection or concern. It would be difficult but not impossible to convince a parent with this attitude to become responsible for the child without the help of counseling. Since the parent may feel shameful of the child and may not admit fear or even dislike of the child, it may be wise to limit time with the child until this situation improves.  Acceptance, understanding and kindness are the best ways to heal the parent so that the child will have two loving parents.\n\nHow the child become disabled may be important, for instance if a disability was caused by a hereditary defect of the father or by the mother's behavior during pregnancy such as drugs or drinking. Depending on the cause, one or both parent might be too protective of the child, such as always worrying about or watching the child or preventing the child to play with others in a normal activity like rollerblading or football.\n\nOther ways problems associated with a disabled child may include behaviors like not maintaining herself or ignoring family or work duties. There might also be a lack of self care and even self destructive attitudes and possible addictive behaviors such as alcohol, drugs (legal and illegal), food (gorging, binging, anorexia) or other issues.\n",,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

This evidence may include, but may\n not be limited to, a conviction within the last five years for the\n illegal use or possession of a controlled substance.  The court shall\n order the least intrusive method of testing for the illegal use of\n controlled substances or the habitual or continual abuse of alcohol\n by either or both parents or the legal custodian.  If substance abuse\n testing is ordered by the court, the testing shall be performed in\n conformance with procedures and standards established by the United\n States Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing of\n federal employees.

Su objetivo es castigar al otro padre poniendo al niño en su contra, y conseguir por medio de mentiras lo que no pudo en la corte: limitar o eliminar el papel que juega el otro padre en la vida de su hijo.  Desgraciadamente, el motivo por lo general es la venganza o el  ganar control, pero también puede ser el resultado de la depresión, o una táctica de negocios para obtener una ventaja financiera. \n\nCualquiera que sea la razón, el padre que aliena, al intentar prevenir que el niño esté con el otro padre, lo está haciendo prisionero.  Entre algunas de las justificaciones más comunes que se utilizan para alentar el rechazo están: 1) Él causó la separación, 2) Él nos abandonó o 3) Él no debe ser parte de la vida del niño porque puede de alguna manera causarle daño.  El padre que le lava el cerebro al niño tiene más éxito cuando éste es el padre custodio, y es con quien el niño pasa la mayoría del tiempo. El otro padre no está ahí para enfrentar las mentiras, si es que se da cuenta de ellas. \n\nPor lo general, el padre que aliena está convencido que lo que reclama es cierto, por lo que convence a otros mucho más fácilmente a apoyarle, e incluso, a  participar en la alienación. Con esto, no queremos decir que el padre que aliena esté siempre equivocado sobre estos asuntos, pero en la realidad, a menos que el abuso o la violencia estén presentes, generalmente esas acusaciones son exageradas.  A menos que una tercera persona neutral se ofrezca a respaldar o rechazar las acusaciones, los amigos y la familia no deberían tomar partido.\n\nA menudo, el padre que aliena va a pretender que Vhe_she aprueba que el otro padre tenga un vínculo con el niño, pero al mismo tiempo, lo sabotea a escondidas, diciéndole al niño que no tenga un vínculo con el otro padre. Entre las declaraciones se incluyen que el otro padre no es apto moralmente o es abusivo, pero en realidad éstas son targiversiones exageradas de la verdad, basadas en diferencias menores en cuando al estilo de crianza.  Las declaraciones  se hacen reales cuando el otro padre se siente aislado del niño, y ese enojo que siente al respecto es presentado como prueba de las mismas. Para parar las acusaciones de mal padre, el niño debe experimentar momentos positivos con el otro padre, y que dichos momentos le sean recordados con frecuencia.\n\nYa sea que dichas razones sean ciertas o no, el niño se siente confundido al principio, deseando creer que ambos padres son buenos.  Al estar escuchando constantemente las historias o que se le diga de las cosas malas más recientes que el otro padre ha hecho, el niño empieza a preguntarse si esas historias pudiesen ser ciertas. La alienación se completa cuando el padre que aliena convence al niño que el otro padre en realidad es alguien malo a quien debe rechazársele, y al reaccionar, el niño debilita el vínculo emocional y fisico con el otro padre.  Siendo niños, nosotros oimos y adoptamos las características (los sentimientos, las creencias, las actitudes y las opiniones) de cada padre, y con la alienación, el niño rechaza las características del padre que esta siendo alienado.\n\nPara cambiar el comportamiento del padre que aliena se podría requerir de una confrontación o de una orden de la corte dándole  el acceso a los niños. En estos casos, el que se mande una multa moneraria o una terapia obligatoria puede que sirva. Las estadísticas prueban que el padre que aliena será posiblemente el que sea rechazado después por el niño, cuando éste se entere de la verdad, y peor aún que el niño tendrá dificultades en sus relaciones sociales y familiares en el futuro. Aún así, algunos padres ignoran toda la información, las amenazas y la terapia, y por lo tanto, a la corte no le queda otra alternativa más que quitarle los derechos de custodia al padre que aliene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the child repeatedly hears the stories or is told about new ""bad things"" the other parent did, the child begins to wonder if the stories just may be true.

This evidence may include, but may\n not be limited to, a conviction within the last five years for the\n illegal use or possession of a controlled substance.  The court shall\n order the least intrusive method of testing for the illegal use of\n controlled substances or the habitual or continual abuse of alcohol\n by either or both parents or the legal custodian.  If substance abuse\n testing is ordered by the court, the testing shall be performed in\n conformance with procedures and standards established by the United\n States Department of Health and Human Services for drug testing of\n federal employees.  The parent or legal custodian who has undergone\n drug testing shall have the right to a hearing, if requested, to\n challenge a positive test result.  A positive test result, even if\n challenged and upheld, shall not, by itself, constitute grounds for\n an adverse custody decision.  Determining the best interests of the\n child requires weighing all relevant factors.  The results of this\n testing shall be confidential, shall be maintained as a sealed record\n in the court file, and may not be released to any person except the\n court, the parties, their attorneys, the Judicial Council (until\n completion of its authorized study of the testing process) and any\n person to whom the court expressly grants access by written order\n made with prior notice to all parties.  Any person who has access to\n the test results may not disseminate copies or disclose information\n about the test results to any person other than a person who is\n authorized to receive the test results pursuant to this section.  Any\n breach of the confidentiality of the test results shall be\n punishable by civil sanctions not to exceed two thousand five hundred\n dollars ($2,500).  The results of the testing may not be used for\n any purpose, including any criminal, civil, or administrative\n proceeding, except to assist the court in determining, for purposes\n of the proceeding, the best interest of the child pursuant to Section\n 3011, and the content of the order or judgment determining custody\n or visitation.  The court may order either party, or both parties, to\n pay the costs of the drug or alcohol testing ordered pursuant to\n this section.  As used in this section, ""controlled substances"" has\n the same meaning as defined in the California Uniform Controlled\n Substances Act, Division 10 (commencing with Section 11000) of the\n Health and Safety Code.\n   (b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1,\n 2008, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted\n statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2008, deletes or extends\n that date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the other Signatories hereto,\n\nTaking into account the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children of 20 May 1980 (ETS No. 105);\n\nTaking into account the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children;\n\nTaking into account the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses;\n\nRecognising that, as provided in the different international legal instruments of the Council of Europe as well as in Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration;\n\nAware of the need for further provisions to safeguard contact between children and their parents and other persons having family ties with children, as protected by Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 4 November 1950 (ETS No. 5);\n\nTaking into account Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which provides for the right of a child, who is separated from one or both parents, to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except when this is contrary to the child's best interests;\n\nTaking into account paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides for the right of the child whose parents reside in different States to maintain on a regular basis, save in exceptional circumstances, personal relations and direct contacts with both parents;\n\nAware of the desirability of recognising not only parents but also children as holders of rights;\n\nAgreeing consequently to replace the notion of ""access to children"" with the notion of ""contact concerning children"";\n\nTaking into account the European Convention on the Exercise of Children’s Rights (ETS No. 160) and the desirability of promoting measures to assist children in matters concerning contact with parents and other persons having family ties with children;\n\nAgreeing on the need for children to have contact not only with both parents but also with certain other persons having family ties with children and the importance for parents and those other persons to remain in contact with children, subject to the best interests of the child;\n\nNoting the need to promote the adoption by States of common principles with respect to contact concerning children, in particular in order to facilitate the application of international instruments in this field;\n\nRealising that machinery set up to give effect to foreign orders relating to contact concerning children is more likely to provide satisfactory results where the principles on which these foreign orders are based are similar to the principles in the State giving effect to such foreign orders;\n\nRecognising the need, when children and parents and other persons having family ties with children live in different States, to encourage judicial authorities to make more frequent use of transfrontier contact and to increase the confidence of all persons concerned that the children will be returned at the end of such contact;\n\nNoting that the provision of efficient safeguards and additional guarantees is likely to ensure the return of children, in particular, at the end of transfrontier contact;\n\nNoting that an additional international instrument is necessary to provide solutions relating in particular to transfrontier contact concerning children;\n\nDesiring to establish co-operation between all central authorities and other bodies in order to promote and improve contact between children and their parents, and other persons having family ties with such children, and in particular to promote judicial co-operation in cases concerning transfrontier contact;\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nChapter I – Objects of the Convention and definitions\n\nArticle 1 – Objects of the Convention\n\nThe objects of this Convention are:\n\na     to determine general principles to be applied to contact orders;\n\nb     to fix appropriate safeguards and guarantees to ensure the proper exercise of contact and the immediate return of children at the end of the period of contact;\n\nc     to establish co-operation between central authorities, judicial authorities and other bodies in order to promote and improve contact between children and their parents, and other persons having family ties with children.\n\nArticle 2 – Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Convention:\n\na     ""contact"" means:\n\ni     the child staying for a limited period of time with or meeting a person mentioned in Articles 4 or 5 with whom he or she is not usually living;\n\nii     any form of communication between the child and such person;\n\niii     the provision of information to such a person about the child or to the child about such a person.\n\nb     ""contact order"" means a decision of a judicial authority concerning contact, including an agreement concerning contact which has been confirmed by a competent judicial authority or which has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic instrument and is enforceable;\n\nc     ""child"" means a person under 18 years of age in respect of whom a contact order may be made or enforced in a State Party;\n\nd    ""family ties"" means a close relationship such as between a child and his or her grandparents or siblings, based on law or on a de facto family relationship;\n\ne     ""judicial authority"" means a court or an administrative authority having equivalent powers.\n\nChapter II – General principles to be applied to contact orders\n\nArticle 3 – Application of principles\n\nStates Parties shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to ensure that the principles contained in this chapter are applied by judicial authorities when making, amending, suspending or revoking contact orders.\n\nArticle 4 – Contact between a child and his or her parents\n\n1     A child and his or her parents shall have the right to obtain and maintain regular contact with each other.\n\n2     Such contact may be restricted or excluded only where necessary in the best interests of the child.\n\n3     Where it is not in the best interests of a child to maintain unsupervised contact with one of his or her parents the possibility of supervised personal contact or other forms of contact with this parent shall be considered.\n\nArticle 5 – Contact between a child and persons other than his or her parents\n\n1     Subject to his or her best interests, contact may be established between the child and persons other than his or her parents having family ties with the child.\n\n2     States Parties are free to extend this provision to persons other than those mentioned in paragraph 1, and where so extended, States may freely decide what aspects of contact, as defined in Article 2 letter a shall apply.\n\nArticle 6 – The right of a child to be informed, consulted and to express his or her views\n\n1     A child considered by internal law as having sufficient understanding shall have the right, unless this would be manifestly contrary to his or her best interests:\n\n–     to receive all relevant information;\n\n–     to be consulted;\n\n–     to express his or her views.\n\n2     Due weight shall be given to those views and to the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child.\n\nArticle 7 – Resolving disputes concerning contact\n\nWhen resolving disputes concerning contact, the judicial authorities shall take all appropriate measures:\n\na     to ensure that both parents are informed of the importance for their child and for both of them of establishing and maintaining regular contact with their child;\n\nb     to encourage parents and other persons having family ties with the child to reach amicable agreements with respect to contact, in particular through the use of family mediation and other processes for resolving disputes;\n\nc     before taking a decision, to ensure that they have sufficient information at their disposal, in particular from the holders of parental responsibilities, in order to take a decision in the best interests of the child and, where necessary, obtain further information from other relevant bodies or persons.\n\nArticle 8 – Contact agreements\n\n1     States Parties shall encourage, by means they consider appropriate, parents and other persons having family ties with the child to comply with the principles laid down in Articles 4 to 7 when making or modifying agreements on contact concerning a child. These agreements should preferably be in writing.\n\n2     Upon request, judicial authorities shall, except where internal law otherwise provides, confirm an agreement on contact concerning a child, unless it is contrary to the best interests of the child.\n\nArticle 9 – The carrying into effect of contact orders\n\nStates Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that contact orders are carried into effect.\n\nArticle 10 – Safeguards and guarantees to be taken concerning contact\n\n1     Each State Party shall provide for and promote the use of safeguards and guarantees.

Changes of available safeguards and guarantees shall be communicated as soon as possible.\n\n2     Where the circumstances of the case so require, judicial authorities may, at any time, make a contact order subject to any safeguards and guarantees both for the purpose of ensuring that the order is carried into effect and that either the child is returned at the end of the period of contact to the place where he or she usually lives or that he or she is not improperly removed.\n\na     Safeguards and guarantees for ensuring that the order is carried into effect, may in particular include:\n\n–     supervision of contact;\n\n–     the obligation for a person to provide for the travel and accommodation expenses of the child and, as may be appropriate, of any other person accompanying the child;\n\n–     a security to be deposited by the person with whom the child is usually living to ensure that the person seeking contact with the child is not prevented from having such contact;\n\n–     a fine to be imposed on the person with whom the child is usually living, should this person refuse to comply with the contact order.\n\nb     Safeguards and guarantees for ensuring the return of the child or preventing an improper removal, may in particular include:\n\n–     the surrender of passports or identity documents and, where appropriate, a document indicating that the person seeking contact has notified the competent consular authority about such a surrender during the period of contact;\n\n–     financial guarantees;\n\n–     charges on property;\n\n–     undertakings or stipulations to the court;\n\n–     the obligation of the person having contact with the child to present himself or herself, with the child regularly before a competent body such as a youth welfare authority or a police station, in the place where contact is to be exercised;\n\n–     the obligation of the person seeking contact to present a document issued by the State where contact is to take place, certifying the recognition and declaration of enforceability of a custody or a contact order or both either before a contact order is made or before contact takes place;\n\n–     the imposition of conditions in relation to the place where contact is to be exercised and, where appropriate, the registration, in any national or transfrontier information system, of a prohibition preventing the child from leaving the State where contact is to take place.\n\n3     Any such safeguards and guarantees shall be in writing or evidenced in writing and shall form part of the contact order or the confirmed agreement.\n\n4     If safeguards or guarantees are to be implemented in another State Party, the judicial authority shall preferably order such safeguards or guarantees as are capable of implementation in that State Party.\n\nChapter III – Measures to promote and improve transfrontier contact\n\nArticle 11 – Central authorities\n\n1     Each State Party shall appoint a central authority to carry out the functions provided for by this Convention in cases of transfrontier contact.\n\n2     Federal States, States with more than one system of law or States having autonomous territorial units shall be free to appoint more than one central authority and to specify the territorial or personal extent of their functions.

In no circumstances may the foreign decision be reviewed as to its substance.\n\nArticle 16 – Return of a child\n\n1     Where a child at the end of a period of transfrontier contact based on a contact order is not returned, the competent authorities shall, upon request, ensure the child’s immediate return, where applicable, by applying the relevant provisions of international instruments, of internal law and by implementing, where appropriate, such safeguards and guarantees as may be provided in the contact order.\n\n2     A decision on the return of the child shall be made, whenever possible, within six weeks of the date of an application for the return.\n\nArticle 17 – Costs\n\nWith the exception of the cost of repatriation, each State Party undertakes not to claim any payment from an applicant in respect of any measures taken under this Convention by the central authority itself of that State on the applicant's behalf.\n\nArticle 18 – Language requirement\n\n1     Subject to any special agreements made between the central authorities concerned:\n\na     communications to the central authority of the State addressed shall be made in the official language or in one of the official languages of that State or be accompanied by a translation into that language;\n\nb     the central authority of the State addressed shall nevertheless accept communications made in English or in French, or accompanied by a translation into one of these languages.\n\n2     Communications coming from the central authority of the State addressed, including the results of enquiries carried out, may be made in the official language or one of the official languages of that State or in English or French.\n\n3     However, a State Party may, by making a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, object to the use of either French or English under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, in any application, communication or other documents sent to their central authorities.\n\nChapter IV – Relationship with other instruments\n\nArticle 19 – Relationship with the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children\n\nParagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 11 of the European Convention of 20 May 1980 (ETS N° 105) on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children shall not be applied in relations between States Parties which are also States Parties of the present Convention.\n\nArticle 20 – Relationships with other instruments\n\n1     This Convention shall not affect any international instrument to which States Parties to the present Convention are Parties or shall become Parties and which contains provisions on matters governed by this Convention.

What Are the Federal Laws Prohibiting Job Discrimination?\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), which protects men and women who perform substantially equal work in the same establishment from sex-based wage discrimination;\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older;\nTitle I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), which prohibit employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the private sector, and in state and local governments;\nSections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who work in the federal government;\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on genetic information about an applicant, employee, or former employee; and\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, which, among other things, provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination.\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all of these laws. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.\n\nOther federal laws, not enforced by EEOC, also prohibit discrimination and reprisal against federal employees and applicants. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) contains a number of prohibitions, known as prohibited personnel practices, which are designed to promote overall fairness in federal personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. 2302. The CSRA prohibits any employee who has authority to take certain personnel actions from discriminating for or against employees or applicants for employment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability. It also provides that certain personnel actions can not be based on attributes or conduct that do not adversely affect employee performance, such as marital status and political affiliation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has interpreted the prohibition of discrimination based on conduct to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CSRA also prohibits reprisal against federal employees or applicants for whistle-blowing, or for exercising an appeal, complaint, or grievance right. The CSRA is enforced by both the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).\n\nAdditional information about the enforcement of the CSRA may be found on the OPM web site at http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/guide01.htm; from OSC at (202) 653-7188 or at http://www.osc.gov/; and from MSPB at (202) 653-6772 or at http://www.mspb.gov/ .\n\nDiscriminatory Practices\n\nII. What Discriminatory Practices Are Prohibited by These Laws? Under Title VII, the ADA, GINA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in any aspect of employment, including:\n\nhiring and firing;\ncompensation, assignment, or classification of employees;\ntransfer, promotion, layoff, or recall;\njob advertisements;\nrecruitment;\ntesting;\nuse of company facilities;\ntraining and apprenticeship programs;\nfringe benefits;\npay, retirement plans, and disability leave; or\nother terms and conditions of employment.\nDiscriminatory practices under these laws also include:\n\nharassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, or age;\nretaliation against an individual for filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices;\nemployment decisions based on stereotypes or assumptions about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain sex, race, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities, or based on myths or assumptions about an individual's genetic information; and\ndenying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability. Title VII also prohibits discrimination because of participation in schools or places of worship associated with a particular racial, ethnic, or religious group.\nEmployers are required to post notices to all employees advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nNote: Many states and municipalities also have enacted protections against discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, status as a parent, marital status and political affiliation. For information, please contact the EEOC District Office nearest you.\n\nIII. What Other Practices Are Discriminatory Under These Laws?\n\nTitle VII\n\nTitle VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination, but also practices that have the effect of discriminating against individuals because of their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.\n\nNational Origin Discrimination\n\nIt is illegal to discriminate against an individual because of birthplace, ancestry, culture, or linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group.\nA rule requiring that employees speak only English on the job may violate Title VII unless an employer shows that the requirement is necessary for conducting business. If the employer believes such a rule is necessary, employees must be informed when English is required and the consequences for violating the rule.\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to assure that employees hired are legally authorized to work in the U.S. However, an employer who requests employment verification only for individuals of a particular national origin, or individuals who appear to be or sound foreign, may violate both Title VII and IRCA; verification must be obtained from all applicants and employees. Employers who impose citizenship requirements or give preferences to U.S. citizens in hiring or employment opportunities also may violate IRCA.\n\nAdditional information about IRCA may be obtained from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at 1-800-255-7688 (voice), 1-800-237-2515 (TTY for employees/applicants) or 1-800-362-2735 (TTY for employers) or at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc.\n\nReligious Accommodation\n\nAn employer is required to reasonably accommodate the religious belief of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.\nSex Discrimination\n\nTitle VII's broad prohibitions against sex discrimination specifically cover:\n\nSexual Harassment - This includes practices ranging from direct requests for sexual favors to workplace conditions that create a hostile environment for persons of either gender, including same sex harassment. (The ""hostile environment"" standard also applies to harassment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, age, and disability.)\nPregnancy Based Discrimination - Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions.\nAdditional rights are available to parents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor. For information on the FMLA, or to file an FMLA complaint, individuals should contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division is listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor or at http://www.dol.gov/esa/public/whd_org.htm.\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nThe ADEA's broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits:\n\nstatements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ);\ndiscrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and\ndenial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.\nEqual Pay Act\n\nThe EPA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits, where men and women perform work of similar skill, effort, and responsibility for the same employer under similar working conditions.\n\nNote that:\n\nEmployers may not reduce wages of either sex to equalize pay between men and women.\nA violation of the EPA may occur where a different wage was/is paid to a person who worked in the same job before or after an employee of the opposite sex.\nA violation may also occur where a labor union causes the employer to violate the law.\nTitles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended\n\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. It is necessary to understand several important ADA definitions to know who is protected by the law and what constitutes illegal discrimination:\n\nIndividual with a Disability\n\nAn individual with a disability under the ADA is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having a disability. An entity subject to the ADA regards someone as having a disability when it takes an action prohibited by the ADA based on an actual or perceived impairment, except if the impairment is both transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. Major life activities are basic activities that most people in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty such as walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, thinking, and eating. Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as functions of the immune system normal cell growth, brain, neurological, and endocrine functions.\n\n""Qualified""\n\nAn individual with a disability is ""qualified"" if he or she satisfies skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nReasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; job restructuring; modification of work schedules; providing additional unpaid leave; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment or devices; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Reasonable accommodation may be necessary to apply for a job, to perform job functions, or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are enjoyed by people without disabilities. An employer is not required to lower production standards to make an accommodation. An employer generally is not obligated to provide personal use items such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. A person who only meets the ""regarded as"" definition of disability is not entitled to receive a reasonable accommodation.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nAn employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship means an action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as a business' size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\nProhibited Inquiries and Examinations\n\nBefore making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in the same job category. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Use\n\nEmployees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not protected by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal use of drugs are not considered medical examinations and, therefore, are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold individuals who are illegally using drugs and individuals with alcoholism to the same standards of performance as other employees.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC. Enacted in part to reverse several Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of persons protected by these laws, the Act also provides additional protections. The Act authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination, and provides for obtaining attorneys' fees and the possibility of jury trials. It also directs the EEOC to expand its technical assistance and outreach activities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008\n\nGINA prohibits discrimination against applicants, employees, and former employees on the basis of genetic information. This includes a prohibition on the use of genetic information in all employment decisions; restrictions on the ability of employers and other covered entities to request or to acquire genetic information, with limited exceptions; and a requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any genetic information acquired, with limited exceptions.\n\nEmployers And Other Entities Covered By EEO Laws\n\nIV. Which Employers and Other Entities Are Covered by These Laws?\n\nTitle VII, the ADA, and GINA cover all private employers, state and local governments, and education institutions that employ 15 or more individuals. These laws also cover private and public employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor management committees controlling apprenticeship and training.\n\nThe ADEA covers all private employers with 20 or more employees, state and local governments (including school districts), employment agencies and labor organizations.\n\nThe EPA covers all employers who are covered by the Federal Wage and Hour Law (the Fair Labor Standards Act). Virtually all employers are subject to the provisions of this Act.\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, GINA, and the EPA also cover the federal government. In addition, the federal government is covered by Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which incorporate the requirements of the ADA. However, different procedures are used for processing complaints of federal discrimination. For more information on how to file a complaint of federal discrimination, contact the EEO office of the federal agency where the alleged discrimination occurred.\n\nThe CSRA (not enforced by EEOC) covers most federal agency employees except employees of a government corporation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof, the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, or the General Accounting Office.\n\nThe EEOC'S Charge Processing Procedures\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nV. Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAny individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with EEOC.\nIn addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person's identity.\nVI. How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed?\n\nA charge may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. Individuals may consult their local telephone directory (U.S. Government listing) or call 1-800-669-4000 (voice) or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY) to contact the nearest EEOC office for more information on specific procedures for filing a charge.\nIndividuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can be made.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVII. What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge?\n\nThe complaining party's name, address, and telephone number;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known;\nA short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and\nThe date(s) of the alleged violation(s).\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVIII. What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAll laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act, require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:\n\nA charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights.\nThis 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 days if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. For ADEA charges, only state laws extend the filing limit to 300 days.\nThese time limits do not apply to claims under the Equal Pay Act, because under that Act persons do not have to first file a charge with EEOC in order to have the right to go to court. However, since many EPA claims also raise Title VII sex discrimination issues, it may be advisable to file charges under both laws within the time limits indicated.\nTo protect legal rights, it is always best to contact EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nIX. What Agency Handles a Charge that is also Covered by State or Local Law?\n\nMany states and localities have anti-discrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. EEOC refers to these agencies as ""Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs)."" Through the use of ""work sharing agreements,"" EEOC and the FEPAs avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party's rights are protected under both federal and state law.\n\nIf a charge is filed with a FEPA and is also covered by federal law, the FEPA ""dual files"" the charge with EEOC to protect federal rights. The charge usually will be retained by the FEPA for handling.\nIf a charge is filed with EEOC and also is covered by state or local law, EEOC ""dual files"" the charge with the state or local FEPA, but ordinarily retains the charge for handling.\nX. What Happens after a Charge is Filed with EEOC?\n\nThe employer is notified that the charge has been filed. From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled:\n\nA charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is less strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred.\nEEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are not successful, the investigation continues.\nIn investigating a charge, EEOC may make written requests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. When the investigation is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer, as appropriate.\nThe charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent from both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation.\nA charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the agency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a notice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXI. How Does EEOC Resolve Discrimination Charges?\n\nIf the evidence obtained in an investigation does not establish that discrimination occurred, this will be explained to the charging party. A required notice is then issued, closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nIf the evidence establishes that discrimination has occurred, the employer and the charging party will be informed of this in a letter of determination that explains the finding. EEOC will then attempt conciliation with the employer to develop a remedy for the discrimination.\nIf the case is successfully conciliated, or if a case has earlier been successfully mediated or settled, neither EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation, mediation, or settlement agreement is not honored.\nIf EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the case, the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court. If EEOC decides not to sue, it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. In Title VII and ADA cases against state or local governments, the Department of Justice takes these actions.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXII. When Can an Individual File an Employment Discrimination Lawsuit in Court?\n\nA charging party may file a lawsuit within 90 days after receiving a notice of a ""right to sue"" from EEOC, as stated above. Under Title VII, the ADA, and GINA, a charging party also can request a notice of ""right to sue"" from EEOC 180 days after the charge was first filed with the Commission, and may then bring suit within 90 days after receiving this notice. Under the ADEA, a suit may be filed at any time 60 days after filing a charge with EEOC, but not later than 90 days after EEOC gives notice that it has completed action on the charge.\n\nUnder the EPA, a lawsuit must be filed within two years (three years for willful violations) of the discriminatory act, which in most cases is payment of a discriminatory lower wage.\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nXIII. What Remedies Are Available When Discrimination Is Found?\n\nThe ""relief"" or remedies available for employment discrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that have a discriminatory effect, may include:\n\nback pay,\nhiring,\npromotion,\nreinstatement,\nfront pay,\nreasonable accommodation, or\nother actions that will make an individual ""whole"" (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimination).\nRemedies also may include payment of:\n\nattorneys' fees,\nexpert witness fees, and\ncourt costs.\nUnder most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and punitive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is found. Damages may be available to compensate for actual monetary losses, for future monetary losses, and for mental anguish and inconvenience. Punitive damages also may be available if an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. Punitive damages are not available against the federal, state or local governments.\n\nIn cases concerning reasonable accommodation under the ADA, compensatory or punitive damages may not be awarded to the charging party if an employer can demonstrate that ""good faith"" efforts were made to provide reasonable accommodation.\n\nAn employer may be required to post notices to all employees addressing the violations of a specific charge and advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nThe employer also may be required to take corrective or preventive actions to cure the source of the identified discrimination and minimize the chance of its recurrence, as well as discontinue the specific discriminatory practices involved in the case.\n\nThe Commission\n\nXIV. What Is EEOC and How Does It Operate?\n\nEEOC is an independent federal agency originally created by Congress in 1964 to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission is composed of five Commissioners and a General Counsel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Commissioners are appointed for five-year staggered terms; the General Counsel's term is four years. The President designates a Chair and a Vice-Chair.

What Discriminatory Practices Are Prohibited by These Laws? Under Title VII, the ADA, GINA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in any aspect of employment, including:\n\nhiring and firing;\ncompensation, assignment, or classification of employees;\ntransfer, promotion, layoff, or recall;\njob advertisements;\nrecruitment;\ntesting;\nuse of company facilities;\ntraining and apprenticeship programs;\nfringe benefits;\npay, retirement plans, and disability leave; or\nother terms and conditions of employment.\nDiscriminatory practices under these laws also include:\n\nharassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, or age;\nretaliation against an individual for filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices;\nemployment decisions based on stereotypes or assumptions about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain sex, race, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities, or based on myths or assumptions about an individual's genetic information; and\ndenying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability.

What Other Practices Are Discriminatory Under These Laws?\n\nTitle VII\n\nTitle VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination, but also practices that have the effect of discriminating against individuals because of their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.\n\nNational Origin Discrimination\n\nIt is illegal to discriminate against an individual because of birthplace, ancestry, culture, or linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group.\nA rule requiring that employees speak only English on the job may violate Title VII unless an employer shows that the requirement is necessary for conducting business. If the employer believes such a rule is necessary, employees must be informed when English is required and the consequences for violating the rule.\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to assure that employees hired are legally authorized to work in the U.S. However, an employer who requests employment verification only for individuals of a particular national origin, or individuals who appear to be or sound foreign, may violate both Title VII and IRCA; verification must be obtained from all applicants and employees. Employers who impose citizenship requirements or give preferences to U.S. citizens in hiring or employment opportunities also may violate IRCA.\n\nAdditional information about IRCA may be obtained from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at 1-800-255-7688 (voice), 1-800-237-2515 (TTY for employees/applicants) or 1-800-362-2735 (TTY for employers) or at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc.\n\nReligious Accommodation\n\nAn employer is required to reasonably accommodate the religious belief of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.\nSex Discrimination\n\nTitle VII's broad prohibitions against sex discrimination specifically cover:\n\nSexual Harassment - This includes practices ranging from direct requests for sexual favors to workplace conditions that create a hostile environment for persons of either gender, including same sex harassment. (The ""hostile environment"" standard also applies to harassment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, age, and disability.)\nPregnancy Based Discrimination - Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions.\nAdditional rights are available to parents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor. For information on the FMLA, or to file an FMLA complaint, individuals should contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division is listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor or at http://www.dol.gov/esa/public/whd_org.htm.\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nThe ADEA's broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits:\n\nstatements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ);\ndiscrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and\ndenial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.\nEqual Pay Act\n\nThe EPA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits, where men and women perform work of similar skill, effort, and responsibility for the same employer under similar working conditions.\n\nNote that:\n\nEmployers may not reduce wages of either sex to equalize pay between men and women.\nA violation of the EPA may occur where a different wage was/is paid to a person who worked in the same job before or after an employee of the opposite sex.\nA violation may also occur where a labor union causes the employer to violate the law.\nTitles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended\n\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. It is necessary to understand several important ADA definitions to know who is protected by the law and what constitutes illegal discrimination:\n\nIndividual with a Disability\n\nAn individual with a disability under the ADA is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having a disability. An entity subject to the ADA regards someone as having a disability when it takes an action prohibited by the ADA based on an actual or perceived impairment, except if the impairment is both transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. Major life activities are basic activities that most people in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty such as walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, thinking, and eating. Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as functions of the immune system normal cell growth, brain, neurological, and endocrine functions.\n\n""Qualified""\n\nAn individual with a disability is ""qualified"" if he or she satisfies skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nReasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; job restructuring; modification of work schedules; providing additional unpaid leave; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment or devices; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Reasonable accommodation may be necessary to apply for a job, to perform job functions, or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are enjoyed by people without disabilities. An employer is not required to lower production standards to make an accommodation. An employer generally is not obligated to provide personal use items such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. A person who only meets the ""regarded as"" definition of disability is not entitled to receive a reasonable accommodation.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nAn employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship means an action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as a business' size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\nProhibited Inquiries and Examinations\n\nBefore making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in the same job category. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Use\n\nEmployees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not protected by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal use of drugs are not considered medical examinations and, therefore, are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold individuals who are illegally using drugs and individuals with alcoholism to the same standards of performance as other employees.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC. Enacted in part to reverse several Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of persons protected by these laws, the Act also provides additional protections. The Act authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination, and provides for obtaining attorneys' fees and the possibility of jury trials. It also directs the EEOC to expand its technical assistance and outreach activities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008\n\nGINA prohibits discrimination against applicants, employees, and former employees on the basis of genetic information. This includes a prohibition on the use of genetic information in all employment decisions; restrictions on the ability of employers and other covered entities to request or to acquire genetic information, with limited exceptions; and a requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any genetic information acquired, with limited exceptions.\n\nEmployers And Other Entities Covered By EEO Laws\n\nIV. Which Employers and Other Entities Are Covered by These Laws?\n\nTitle VII, the ADA, and GINA cover all private employers, state and local governments, and education institutions that employ 15 or more individuals. These laws also cover private and public employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor management committees controlling apprenticeship and training.\n\nThe ADEA covers all private employers with 20 or more employees, state and local governments (including school districts), employment agencies and labor organizations.\n\nThe EPA covers all employers who are covered by the Federal Wage and Hour Law (the Fair Labor Standards Act). Virtually all employers are subject to the provisions of this Act.\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, GINA, and the EPA also cover the federal government. In addition, the federal government is covered by Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which incorporate the requirements of the ADA. However, different procedures are used for processing complaints of federal discrimination. For more information on how to file a complaint of federal discrimination, contact the EEO office of the federal agency where the alleged discrimination occurred.\n\nThe CSRA (not enforced by EEOC) covers most federal agency employees except employees of a government corporation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof, the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, or the General Accounting Office.\n\nThe EEOC'S Charge Processing Procedures\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nV. Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAny individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with EEOC.\nIn addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person's identity.\nVI. How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed?\n\nA charge may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. Individuals may consult their local telephone directory (U.S. Government listing) or call 1-800-669-4000 (voice) or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY) to contact the nearest EEOC office for more information on specific procedures for filing a charge.\nIndividuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can be made.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVII. What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge?\n\nThe complaining party's name, address, and telephone number;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known;\nA short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and\nThe date(s) of the alleged violation(s).\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVIII. What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAll laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act, require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:\n\nA charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights.\nThis 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 days if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. For ADEA charges, only state laws extend the filing limit to 300 days.\nThese time limits do not apply to claims under the Equal Pay Act, because under that Act persons do not have to first file a charge with EEOC in order to have the right to go to court. However, since many EPA claims also raise Title VII sex discrimination issues, it may be advisable to file charges under both laws within the time limits indicated.\nTo protect legal rights, it is always best to contact EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nIX. What Agency Handles a Charge that is also Covered by State or Local Law?\n\nMany states and localities have anti-discrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. EEOC refers to these agencies as ""Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs)."" Through the use of ""work sharing agreements,"" EEOC and the FEPAs avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party's rights are protected under both federal and state law.\n\nIf a charge is filed with a FEPA and is also covered by federal law, the FEPA ""dual files"" the charge with EEOC to protect federal rights. The charge usually will be retained by the FEPA for handling.\nIf a charge is filed with EEOC and also is covered by state or local law, EEOC ""dual files"" the charge with the state or local FEPA, but ordinarily retains the charge for handling.\nX. What Happens after a Charge is Filed with EEOC?\n\nThe employer is notified that the charge has been filed. From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled:\n\nA charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is less strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred.\nEEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are not successful, the investigation continues.\nIn investigating a charge, EEOC may make written requests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. When the investigation is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer, as appropriate.\nThe charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent from both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation.\nA charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the agency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a notice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXI. How Does EEOC Resolve Discrimination Charges?\n\nIf the evidence obtained in an investigation does not establish that discrimination occurred, this will be explained to the charging party. A required notice is then issued, closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nIf the evidence establishes that discrimination has occurred, the employer and the charging party will be informed of this in a letter of determination that explains the finding. EEOC will then attempt conciliation with the employer to develop a remedy for the discrimination.\nIf the case is successfully conciliated, or if a case has earlier been successfully mediated or settled, neither EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation, mediation, or settlement agreement is not honored.\nIf EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the case, the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court. If EEOC decides not to sue, it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. In Title VII and ADA cases against state or local governments, the Department of Justice takes these actions.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXII. When Can an Individual File an Employment Discrimination Lawsuit in Court?\n\nA charging party may file a lawsuit within 90 days after receiving a notice of a ""right to sue"" from EEOC, as stated above. Under Title VII, the ADA, and GINA, a charging party also can request a notice of ""right to sue"" from EEOC 180 days after the charge was first filed with the Commission, and may then bring suit within 90 days after receiving this notice. Under the ADEA, a suit may be filed at any time 60 days after filing a charge with EEOC, but not later than 90 days after EEOC gives notice that it has completed action on the charge.\n\nUnder the EPA, a lawsuit must be filed within two years (three years for willful violations) of the discriminatory act, which in most cases is payment of a discriminatory lower wage.\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nXIII. What Remedies Are Available When Discrimination Is Found?\n\nThe ""relief"" or remedies available for employment discrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that have a discriminatory effect, may include:\n\nback pay,\nhiring,\npromotion,\nreinstatement,\nfront pay,\nreasonable accommodation, or\nother actions that will make an individual ""whole"" (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimination).\nRemedies also may include payment of:\n\nattorneys' fees,\nexpert witness fees, and\ncourt costs.\nUnder most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and punitive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is found. Damages may be available to compensate for actual monetary losses, for future monetary losses, and for mental anguish and inconvenience. Punitive damages also may be available if an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. Punitive damages are not available against the federal, state or local governments.\n\nIn cases concerning reasonable accommodation under the ADA, compensatory or punitive damages may not be awarded to the charging party if an employer can demonstrate that ""good faith"" efforts were made to provide reasonable accommodation.\n\nAn employer may be required to post notices to all employees addressing the violations of a specific charge and advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nThe employer also may be required to take corrective or preventive actions to cure the source of the identified discrimination and minimize the chance of its recurrence, as well as discontinue the specific discriminatory practices involved in the case.\n\nThe Commission\n\nXIV. What Is EEOC and How Does It Operate?\n\nEEOC is an independent federal agency originally created by Congress in 1964 to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission is composed of five Commissioners and a General Counsel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Commissioners are appointed for five-year staggered terms; the General Counsel's term is four years. The President designates a Chair and a Vice-Chair.

What Are the Federal Laws Prohibiting Job Discrimination?\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), which protects men and women who perform substantially equal work in the same establishment from sex-based wage discrimination;\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older;\nTitle I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), which prohibit employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the private sector, and in state and local governments;\nSections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who work in the federal government;\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on genetic information about an applicant, employee, or former employee; and\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, which, among other things, provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination.\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all of these laws. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.\n\nOther federal laws, not enforced by EEOC, also prohibit discrimination and reprisal against federal employees and applicants. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) contains a number of prohibitions, known as prohibited personnel practices, which are designed to promote overall fairness in federal personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. 2302. The CSRA prohibits any employee who has authority to take certain personnel actions from discriminating for or against employees or applicants for employment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability. It also provides that certain personnel actions can not be based on attributes or conduct that do not adversely affect employee performance, such as marital status and political affiliation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has interpreted the prohibition of discrimination based on conduct to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CSRA also prohibits reprisal against federal employees or applicants for whistle-blowing, or for exercising an appeal, complaint, or grievance right. The CSRA is enforced by both the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).\n\nAdditional information about the enforcement of the CSRA may be found on the OPM web site at http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/guide01.htm; from OSC at (202) 653-7188 or at http://www.osc.gov/; and from MSPB at (202) 653-6772 or at http://www.mspb.gov/ .\n\nDiscriminatory Practices\n\nII. What Discriminatory Practices Are Prohibited by These Laws? Under Title VII, the ADA, GINA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in any aspect of employment, including:\n\nhiring and firing;\ncompensation, assignment, or classification of employees;\ntransfer, promotion, layoff, or recall;\njob advertisements;\nrecruitment;\ntesting;\nuse of company facilities;\ntraining and apprenticeship programs;\nfringe benefits;\npay, retirement plans, and disability leave; or\nother terms and conditions of employment.\nDiscriminatory practices under these laws also include:\n\nharassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, or age;\nretaliation against an individual for filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices;\nemployment decisions based on stereotypes or assumptions about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain sex, race, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities, or based on myths or assumptions about an individual's genetic information; and\ndenying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability. Title VII also prohibits discrimination because of participation in schools or places of worship associated with a particular racial, ethnic, or religious group.\nEmployers are required to post notices to all employees advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nNote: Many states and municipalities also have enacted protections against discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, status as a parent, marital status and political affiliation. For information, please contact the EEOC District Office nearest you.\n\nIII. What Other Practices Are Discriminatory Under These Laws?\n\nTitle VII\n\nTitle VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination, but also practices that have the effect of discriminating against individuals because of their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.\n\nNational Origin Discrimination\n\nIt is illegal to discriminate against an individual because of birthplace, ancestry, culture, or linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group.\nA rule requiring that employees speak only English on the job may violate Title VII unless an employer shows that the requirement is necessary for conducting business. If the employer believes such a rule is necessary, employees must be informed when English is required and the consequences for violating the rule.\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to assure that employees hired are legally authorized to work in the U.S. However, an employer who requests employment verification only for individuals of a particular national origin, or individuals who appear to be or sound foreign, may violate both Title VII and IRCA; verification must be obtained from all applicants and employees. Employers who impose citizenship requirements or give preferences to U.S. citizens in hiring or employment opportunities also may violate IRCA.\n\nAdditional information about IRCA may be obtained from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at 1-800-255-7688 (voice), 1-800-237-2515 (TTY for employees/applicants) or 1-800-362-2735 (TTY for employers) or at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc.\n\nReligious Accommodation\n\nAn employer is required to reasonably accommodate the religious belief of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.\nSex Discrimination\n\nTitle VII's broad prohibitions against sex discrimination specifically cover:\n\nSexual Harassment - This includes practices ranging from direct requests for sexual favors to workplace conditions that create a hostile environment for persons of either gender, including same sex harassment. (The ""hostile environment"" standard also applies to harassment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, age, and disability.)\nPregnancy Based Discrimination - Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions.\nAdditional rights are available to parents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor. For information on the FMLA, or to file an FMLA complaint, individuals should contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division is listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor or at http://www.dol.gov/esa/public/whd_org.htm.\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nThe ADEA's broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits:\n\nstatements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ);\ndiscrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and\ndenial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.\nEqual Pay Act\n\nThe EPA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits, where men and women perform work of similar skill, effort, and responsibility for the same employer under similar working conditions.\n\nNote that:\n\nEmployers may not reduce wages of either sex to equalize pay between men and women.\nA violation of the EPA may occur where a different wage was/is paid to a person who worked in the same job before or after an employee of the opposite sex.\nA violation may also occur where a labor union causes the employer to violate the law.\nTitles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended\n\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. It is necessary to understand several important ADA definitions to know who is protected by the law and what constitutes illegal discrimination:\n\nIndividual with a Disability\n\nAn individual with a disability under the ADA is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having a disability. An entity subject to the ADA regards someone as having a disability when it takes an action prohibited by the ADA based on an actual or perceived impairment, except if the impairment is both transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. Major life activities are basic activities that most people in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty such as walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, thinking, and eating. Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as functions of the immune system normal cell growth, brain, neurological, and endocrine functions.\n\n""Qualified""\n\nAn individual with a disability is ""qualified"" if he or she satisfies skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nReasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; job restructuring; modification of work schedules; providing additional unpaid leave; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment or devices; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Reasonable accommodation may be necessary to apply for a job, to perform job functions, or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are enjoyed by people without disabilities. An employer is not required to lower production standards to make an accommodation. An employer generally is not obligated to provide personal use items such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. A person who only meets the ""regarded as"" definition of disability is not entitled to receive a reasonable accommodation.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nAn employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship means an action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as a business' size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\nProhibited Inquiries and Examinations\n\nBefore making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in the same job category. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Use\n\nEmployees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not protected by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal use of drugs are not considered medical examinations and, therefore, are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold individuals who are illegally using drugs and individuals with alcoholism to the same standards of performance as other employees.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC. Enacted in part to reverse several Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of persons protected by these laws, the Act also provides additional protections. The Act authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination, and provides for obtaining attorneys' fees and the possibility of jury trials. It also directs the EEOC to expand its technical assistance and outreach activities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008\n\nGINA prohibits discrimination against applicants, employees, and former employees on the basis of genetic information. This includes a prohibition on the use of genetic information in all employment decisions; restrictions on the ability of employers and other covered entities to request or to acquire genetic information, with limited exceptions; and a requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any genetic information acquired, with limited exceptions.\n\nEmployers And Other Entities Covered By EEO Laws\n\nIV. Which Employers and Other Entities Are Covered by These Laws?\n\nTitle VII, the ADA, and GINA cover all private employers, state and local governments, and education institutions that employ 15 or more individuals. These laws also cover private and public employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor management committees controlling apprenticeship and training.\n\nThe ADEA covers all private employers with 20 or more employees, state and local governments (including school districts), employment agencies and labor organizations.\n\nThe EPA covers all employers who are covered by the Federal Wage and Hour Law (the Fair Labor Standards Act). Virtually all employers are subject to the provisions of this Act.\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, GINA, and the EPA also cover the federal government. In addition, the federal government is covered by Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which incorporate the requirements of the ADA. However, different procedures are used for processing complaints of federal discrimination. For more information on how to file a complaint of federal discrimination, contact the EEO office of the federal agency where the alleged discrimination occurred.\n\nThe CSRA (not enforced by EEOC) covers most federal agency employees except employees of a government corporation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof, the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, or the General Accounting Office.\n\nThe EEOC'S Charge Processing Procedures\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nV. Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAny individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with EEOC.\nIn addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person's identity.\nVI. How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed?\n\nA charge may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. Individuals may consult their local telephone directory (U.S. Government listing) or call 1-800-669-4000 (voice) or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY) to contact the nearest EEOC office for more information on specific procedures for filing a charge.\nIndividuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can be made.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVII. What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge?\n\nThe complaining party's name, address, and telephone number;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known;\nA short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and\nThe date(s) of the alleged violation(s).\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVIII. What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAll laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act, require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:\n\nA charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights.\nThis 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 days if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. For ADEA charges, only state laws extend the filing limit to 300 days.\nThese time limits do not apply to claims under the Equal Pay Act, because under that Act persons do not have to first file a charge with EEOC in order to have the right to go to court. However, since many EPA claims also raise Title VII sex discrimination issues, it may be advisable to file charges under both laws within the time limits indicated.\nTo protect legal rights, it is always best to contact EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nIX. What Agency Handles a Charge that is also Covered by State or Local Law?\n\nMany states and localities have anti-discrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. EEOC refers to these agencies as ""Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs)."" Through the use of ""work sharing agreements,"" EEOC and the FEPAs avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party's rights are protected under both federal and state law.\n\nIf a charge is filed with a FEPA and is also covered by federal law, the FEPA ""dual files"" the charge with EEOC to protect federal rights. The charge usually will be retained by the FEPA for handling.\nIf a charge is filed with EEOC and also is covered by state or local law, EEOC ""dual files"" the charge with the state or local FEPA, but ordinarily retains the charge for handling.\nX. What Happens after a Charge is Filed with EEOC?\n\nThe employer is notified that the charge has been filed. From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled:\n\nA charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is less strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred.\nEEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are not successful, the investigation continues.\nIn investigating a charge, EEOC may make written requests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. When the investigation is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer, as appropriate.\nThe charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent from both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation.\nA charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the agency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a notice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXI. How Does EEOC Resolve Discrimination Charges?\n\nIf the evidence obtained in an investigation does not establish that discrimination occurred, this will be explained to the charging party. A required notice is then issued, closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nIf the evidence establishes that discrimination has occurred, the employer and the charging party will be informed of this in a letter of determination that explains the finding. EEOC will then attempt conciliation with the employer to develop a remedy for the discrimination.\nIf the case is successfully conciliated, or if a case has earlier been successfully mediated or settled, neither EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation, mediation, or settlement agreement is not honored.\nIf EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the case, the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court. If EEOC decides not to sue, it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. In Title VII and ADA cases against state or local governments, the Department of Justice takes these actions.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXII. When Can an Individual File an Employment Discrimination Lawsuit in Court?\n\nA charging party may file a lawsuit within 90 days after receiving a notice of a ""right to sue"" from EEOC, as stated above. Under Title VII, the ADA, and GINA, a charging party also can request a notice of ""right to sue"" from EEOC 180 days after the charge was first filed with the Commission, and may then bring suit within 90 days after receiving this notice. Under the ADEA, a suit may be filed at any time 60 days after filing a charge with EEOC, but not later than 90 days after EEOC gives notice that it has completed action on the charge.\n\nUnder the EPA, a lawsuit must be filed within two years (three years for willful violations) of the discriminatory act, which in most cases is payment of a discriminatory lower wage.\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nXIII. What Remedies Are Available When Discrimination Is Found?\n\nThe ""relief"" or remedies available for employment discrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that have a discriminatory effect, may include:\n\nback pay,\nhiring,\npromotion,\nreinstatement,\nfront pay,\nreasonable accommodation, or\nother actions that will make an individual ""whole"" (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimination).\nRemedies also may include payment of:\n\nattorneys' fees,\nexpert witness fees, and\ncourt costs.\nUnder most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and punitive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is found. Damages may be available to compensate for actual monetary losses, for future monetary losses, and for mental anguish and inconvenience. Punitive damages also may be available if an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. Punitive damages are not available against the federal, state or local governments.\n\nIn cases concerning reasonable accommodation under the ADA, compensatory or punitive damages may not be awarded to the charging party if an employer can demonstrate that ""good faith"" efforts were made to provide reasonable accommodation.\n\nAn employer may be required to post notices to all employees addressing the violations of a specific charge and advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nThe employer also may be required to take corrective or preventive actions to cure the source of the identified discrimination and minimize the chance of its recurrence, as well as discontinue the specific discriminatory practices involved in the case.\n\nThe Commission\n\nXIV. What Is EEOC and How Does It Operate?\n\nEEOC is an independent federal agency originally created by Congress in 1964 to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission is composed of five Commissioners and a General Counsel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Commissioners are appointed for five-year staggered terms; the General Counsel's term is four years. The President designates a Chair and a Vice-Chair. The Chair is the chief executive officer of the Commission. The Commission has authority to establish equal employment policy and to approve litigation.

If the supervisor's harassment results in a hostile work environment, the employer can avoid liability only if it can prove that: 1) it reasonably tried to prevent and promptly correct the harassing behavior; and 2) the employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.\n\nThe employer will be liable for harassment by non-supervisory employees or non-employees over whom it has control (e.g., independent contractors or customers on the premises), if it knew, or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.\n\nWhen investigating allegations of harassment, the EEOC looks at the entire record: including the nature of the conduct, and the context in which the alleged incidents occurred.

It is necessary to understand several important ADA definitions to know who is protected by the law and what constitutes illegal discrimination:\n\nIndividual with a Disability\n\nAn individual with a disability under the ADA is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having a disability. An entity subject to the ADA regards someone as having a disability when it takes an action prohibited by the ADA based on an actual or perceived impairment, except if the impairment is both transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. Major life activities are basic activities that most people in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty such as walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, thinking, and eating. Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as functions of the immune system normal cell growth, brain, neurological, and endocrine functions.\n\n""Qualified""\n\nAn individual with a disability is ""qualified"" if he or she satisfies skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nReasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; job restructuring; modification of work schedules; providing additional unpaid leave; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment or devices; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Reasonable accommodation may be necessary to apply for a job, to perform job functions, or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are enjoyed by people without disabilities. An employer is not required to lower production standards to make an accommodation. An employer generally is not obligated to provide personal use items such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. A person who only meets the ""regarded as"" definition of disability is not entitled to receive a reasonable accommodation.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nAn employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship means an action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as a business' size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\nProhibited Inquiries and Examinations\n\nBefore making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in the same job category. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Use\n\nEmployees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not protected by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal use of drugs are not considered medical examinations and, therefore, are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold individuals who are illegally using drugs and individuals with alcoholism to the same standards of performance as other employees.\n\n",,"A person can show that he or she has a disability in one of three ways:\n\nA person may be disabled if he or she has a physical or mental condition that substantially limits a major life activity (such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing, or learning).\n\nA person may be disabled if he or she has a history of a disability (such as cancer that is in remission).\n\nA person may be disabled if he is believed to have a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor (even if he does not have such an impairment).",,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Veterans' preference applies, to virtually all new appointments in both the competitive and excepted service. Veterans' preference does not guarantee veterans a job and it does not apply to internal agency actions such as promotions, transfers, reassignments and reinstatements.\n\nVeterans' preference can be confusing. In accordance with title 5, United States Code, Section 2108 ( 5 USC 2108) , Veterans’ preference eligibility is based on dates of active duty service, receipt of a campaign badge, Purple Heart, or a service-connected disability. Please know that not all active duty service may qualify for veterans’ preference.\n\nOnly veterans discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions are eligible for veterans' preference. This means you must have been discharged under an honorable or general discharge.\n\nIf you are a ""retired member of the armed forces"" you are not included in the definition of preference eligible unless you are a disabled veteran OR you retired below the rank of major or its equivalent.\n\nThere are basically two types of preference eligibles, disabled (10 point preference eligible) and non-disabled (5 point preference eligibles).\n\nYou are a 5 point preference eligible if your active duty service meets any of the following:\n\n180 or more consecutive days, any part of which occurred during the period beginning September 11, 2001 and ending on a future date prescribed by Presidential proclamation or law as the last date of Operation Iraqi Freedom, \n\nOR Between August 2, 1990 and January 2, 1992, \n\nOR 180 or more consecutive days, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955 and before October 15, 1976.\n\nIn a war, campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized or between April 28, 1952 and July 1, 1955.\n\nYou are a 10 point preference eligible if you served at any time, and you:\n\nhave a service connected disability, OR\nreceived a Purple Heart.\n\nIf you are not sure of your preference eligibility, visit the Department of Labor's Veterans' Preference Advisor.\n\nNow that we have discussed your preference eligibility and the associated points, let's discuss preference groups.

What Are the Federal Laws Prohibiting Job Discrimination?\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), which protects men and women who perform substantially equal work in the same establishment from sex-based wage discrimination;\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which protects individuals who are 40 years of age or older;\nTitle I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (ADA), which prohibit employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the private sector, and in state and local governments;\nSections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibit discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities who work in the federal government;\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), which prohibits employment discrimination based on genetic information about an applicant, employee, or former employee; and\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, which, among other things, provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination.\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces all of these laws. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.\n\nOther federal laws, not enforced by EEOC, also prohibit discrimination and reprisal against federal employees and applicants. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) contains a number of prohibitions, known as prohibited personnel practices, which are designed to promote overall fairness in federal personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. 2302. The CSRA prohibits any employee who has authority to take certain personnel actions from discriminating for or against employees or applicants for employment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age or disability. It also provides that certain personnel actions can not be based on attributes or conduct that do not adversely affect employee performance, such as marital status and political affiliation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has interpreted the prohibition of discrimination based on conduct to include discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CSRA also prohibits reprisal against federal employees or applicants for whistle-blowing, or for exercising an appeal, complaint, or grievance right. The CSRA is enforced by both the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).\n\nAdditional information about the enforcement of the CSRA may be found on the OPM web site at http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/guide01.htm; from OSC at (202) 653-7188 or at http://www.osc.gov/; and from MSPB at (202) 653-6772 or at http://www.mspb.gov/ .\n\nDiscriminatory Practices\n\nII. What Discriminatory Practices Are Prohibited by These Laws? Under Title VII, the ADA, GINA, and the ADEA, it is illegal to discriminate in any aspect of employment, including:\n\nhiring and firing;\ncompensation, assignment, or classification of employees;\ntransfer, promotion, layoff, or recall;\njob advertisements;\nrecruitment;\ntesting;\nuse of company facilities;\ntraining and apprenticeship programs;\nfringe benefits;\npay, retirement plans, and disability leave; or\nother terms and conditions of employment.\nDiscriminatory practices under these laws also include:\n\nharassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, or age;\nretaliation against an individual for filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices;\nemployment decisions based on stereotypes or assumptions about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain sex, race, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities, or based on myths or assumptions about an individual's genetic information; and\ndenying employment opportunities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability. Title VII also prohibits discrimination because of participation in schools or places of worship associated with a particular racial, ethnic, or religious group.\nEmployers are required to post notices to all employees advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nNote: Many states and municipalities also have enacted protections against discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation, status as a parent, marital status and political affiliation. For information, please contact the EEOC District Office nearest you.\n\nIII. What Other Practices Are Discriminatory Under These Laws?\n\nTitle VII\n\nTitle VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination, but also practices that have the effect of discriminating against individuals because of their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.\n\nNational Origin Discrimination\n\nIt is illegal to discriminate against an individual because of birthplace, ancestry, culture, or linguistic characteristics common to a specific ethnic group.\nA rule requiring that employees speak only English on the job may violate Title VII unless an employer shows that the requirement is necessary for conducting business. If the employer believes such a rule is necessary, employees must be informed when English is required and the consequences for violating the rule.\nThe Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires employers to assure that employees hired are legally authorized to work in the U.S. However, an employer who requests employment verification only for individuals of a particular national origin, or individuals who appear to be or sound foreign, may violate both Title VII and IRCA; verification must be obtained from all applicants and employees. Employers who impose citizenship requirements or give preferences to U.S. citizens in hiring or employment opportunities also may violate IRCA.\n\nAdditional information about IRCA may be obtained from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at 1-800-255-7688 (voice), 1-800-237-2515 (TTY for employees/applicants) or 1-800-362-2735 (TTY for employers) or at http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc.\n\nReligious Accommodation\n\nAn employer is required to reasonably accommodate the religious belief of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship.\nSex Discrimination\n\nTitle VII's broad prohibitions against sex discrimination specifically cover:\n\nSexual Harassment - This includes practices ranging from direct requests for sexual favors to workplace conditions that create a hostile environment for persons of either gender, including same sex harassment. (The ""hostile environment"" standard also applies to harassment on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, age, and disability.)\nPregnancy Based Discrimination - Pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions must be treated in the same way as other temporary illnesses or conditions.\nAdditional rights are available to parents and others under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which is enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor. For information on the FMLA, or to file an FMLA complaint, individuals should contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division is listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, Department of Labor or at http://www.dol.gov/esa/public/whd_org.htm.\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nThe ADEA's broad ban against age discrimination also specifically prohibits:\n\nstatements or specifications in job notices or advertisements of age preference and limitations. An age limit may only be specified in the rare circumstance where age has been proven to be a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ);\ndiscrimination on the basis of age by apprenticeship programs, including joint labor-management apprenticeship programs; and\ndenial of benefits to older employees. An employer may reduce benefits based on age only if the cost of providing the reduced benefits to older workers is the same as the cost of providing benefits to younger workers.\nEqual Pay Act\n\nThe EPA prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the payment of wages or benefits, where men and women perform work of similar skill, effort, and responsibility for the same employer under similar working conditions.\n\nNote that:\n\nEmployers may not reduce wages of either sex to equalize pay between men and women.\nA violation of the EPA may occur where a different wage was/is paid to a person who worked in the same job before or after an employee of the opposite sex.\nA violation may also occur where a labor union causes the employer to violate the law.\nTitles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended\n\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all employment practices. It is necessary to understand several important ADA definitions to know who is protected by the law and what constitutes illegal discrimination:\n\nIndividual with a Disability\n\nAn individual with a disability under the ADA is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having a disability. An entity subject to the ADA regards someone as having a disability when it takes an action prohibited by the ADA based on an actual or perceived impairment, except if the impairment is both transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor. Major life activities are basic activities that most people in the general population can perform with little or no difficulty such as walking, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, thinking, and eating. Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, such as functions of the immune system normal cell growth, brain, neurological, and endocrine functions.\n\n""Qualified""\n\nAn individual with a disability is ""qualified"" if he or she satisfies skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position held or desired, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of that position.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nReasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to, making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities; job restructuring; modification of work schedules; providing additional unpaid leave; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment or devices; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials, or policies; and providing qualified readers or interpreters. Reasonable accommodation may be necessary to apply for a job, to perform job functions, or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment that are enjoyed by people without disabilities. An employer is not required to lower production standards to make an accommodation. An employer generally is not obligated to provide personal use items such as eyeglasses or hearing aids. A person who only meets the ""regarded as"" definition of disability is not entitled to receive a reasonable accommodation.\n\nUndue Hardship\n\nAn employer is required to make a reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business. Undue hardship means an action that requires significant difficulty or expense when considered in relation to factors such as a business' size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation.\n\nProhibited Inquiries and Examinations\n\nBefore making an offer of employment, an employer may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability. Applicants may be asked about their ability to perform job functions. A job offer may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination, but only if the examination is required for all entering employees in the same job category. Medical examinations of employees must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nDrug and Alcohol Use\n\nEmployees and applicants currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs are not protected by the ADA when an employer acts on the basis of such use. Tests for illegal use of drugs are not considered medical examinations and, therefore, are not subject to the ADA's restrictions on medical examinations. Employers may hold individuals who are illegally using drugs and individuals with alcoholism to the same standards of performance as other employees.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 made major changes in the federal laws against employment discrimination enforced by EEOC. Enacted in part to reverse several Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of persons protected by these laws, the Act also provides additional protections. The Act authorizes compensatory and punitive damages in cases of intentional discrimination, and provides for obtaining attorneys' fees and the possibility of jury trials. It also directs the EEOC to expand its technical assistance and outreach activities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008\n\nGINA prohibits discrimination against applicants, employees, and former employees on the basis of genetic information. This includes a prohibition on the use of genetic information in all employment decisions; restrictions on the ability of employers and other covered entities to request or to acquire genetic information, with limited exceptions; and a requirement to maintain the confidentiality of any genetic information acquired, with limited exceptions.\n\nEmployers And Other Entities Covered By EEO Laws\n\nIV. Which Employers and Other Entities Are Covered by These Laws?\n\nTitle VII, the ADA, and GINA cover all private employers, state and local governments, and education institutions that employ 15 or more individuals. These laws also cover private and public employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor management committees controlling apprenticeship and training.\n\nThe ADEA covers all private employers with 20 or more employees, state and local governments (including school districts), employment agencies and labor organizations.\n\nThe EPA covers all employers who are covered by the Federal Wage and Hour Law (the Fair Labor Standards Act). Virtually all employers are subject to the provisions of this Act.\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, GINA, and the EPA also cover the federal government. In addition, the federal government is covered by Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which incorporate the requirements of the ADA. However, different procedures are used for processing complaints of federal discrimination. For more information on how to file a complaint of federal discrimination, contact the EEO office of the federal agency where the alleged discrimination occurred.\n\nThe CSRA (not enforced by EEOC) covers most federal agency employees except employees of a government corporation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and as determined by the President, any executive agency or unit thereof, the principal function of which is the conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities, or the General Accounting Office.\n\nThe EEOC'S Charge Processing Procedures\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nV. Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAny individual who believes that his or her employment rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with EEOC.\nIn addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved person's identity.\nVI. How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed?\n\nA charge may be filed by mail or in person at the nearest EEOC office. Individuals may consult their local telephone directory (U.S. Government listing) or call 1-800-669-4000 (voice) or 1-800-669-6820 (TTY) to contact the nearest EEOC office for more information on specific procedures for filing a charge.\nIndividuals who need an accommodation in order to file a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessible format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can be made.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVII. What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge?\n\nThe complaining party's name, address, and telephone number;\nThe name, address, and telephone number of the respondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known;\nA short description of the alleged violation (the event that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and\nThe date(s) of the alleged violation(s).\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nVIII. What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Discrimination?\n\nAll laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act, require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court. There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed:\n\nA charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights.\nThis 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 days if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. For ADEA charges, only state laws extend the filing limit to 300 days.\nThese time limits do not apply to claims under the Equal Pay Act, because under that Act persons do not have to first file a charge with EEOC in order to have the right to go to court. However, since many EPA claims also raise Title VII sex discrimination issues, it may be advisable to file charges under both laws within the time limits indicated.\nTo protect legal rights, it is always best to contact EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nIX. What Agency Handles a Charge that is also Covered by State or Local Law?\n\nMany states and localities have anti-discrimination laws and agencies responsible for enforcing those laws. EEOC refers to these agencies as ""Fair Employment Practices Agencies (FEPAs)."" Through the use of ""work sharing agreements,"" EEOC and the FEPAs avoid duplication of effort while at the same time ensuring that a charging party's rights are protected under both federal and state law.\n\nIf a charge is filed with a FEPA and is also covered by federal law, the FEPA ""dual files"" the charge with EEOC to protect federal rights. The charge usually will be retained by the FEPA for handling.\nIf a charge is filed with EEOC and also is covered by state or local law, EEOC ""dual files"" the charge with the state or local FEPA, but ordinarily retains the charge for handling.\nX. What Happens after a Charge is Filed with EEOC?\n\nThe employer is notified that the charge has been filed. From this point there are a number of ways a charge may be handled:\n\nA charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is less strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine whether it is likely that a violation has occurred.\nEEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of the investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are not successful, the investigation continues.\nIn investigating a charge, EEOC may make written requests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the alleged discrimination occurred. When the investigation is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or employer, as appropriate.\nThe charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation program if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent from both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation.\nA charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the agency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth interview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a notice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXI. How Does EEOC Resolve Discrimination Charges?\n\nIf the evidence obtained in an investigation does not establish that discrimination occurred, this will be explained to the charging party. A required notice is then issued, closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf.\nIf the evidence establishes that discrimination has occurred, the employer and the charging party will be informed of this in a letter of determination that explains the finding. EEOC will then attempt conciliation with the employer to develop a remedy for the discrimination.\nIf the case is successfully conciliated, or if a case has earlier been successfully mediated or settled, neither EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation, mediation, or settlement agreement is not honored.\nIf EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the case, the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court. If EEOC decides not to sue, it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party 90 days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. In Title VII and ADA cases against state or local governments, the Department of Justice takes these actions.\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\nXII. When Can an Individual File an Employment Discrimination Lawsuit in Court?\n\nA charging party may file a lawsuit within 90 days after receiving a notice of a ""right to sue"" from EEOC, as stated above. Under Title VII, the ADA, and GINA, a charging party also can request a notice of ""right to sue"" from EEOC 180 days after the charge was first filed with the Commission, and may then bring suit within 90 days after receiving this notice. Under the ADEA, a suit may be filed at any time 60 days after filing a charge with EEOC, but not later than 90 days after EEOC gives notice that it has completed action on the charge.\n\nUnder the EPA, a lawsuit must be filed within two years (three years for willful violations) of the discriminatory act, which in most cases is payment of a discriminatory lower wage.\n\nFederal employees or applicants for employment should see the fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing.\n\nXIII. What Remedies Are Available When Discrimination Is Found?\n\nThe ""relief"" or remedies available for employment discrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that have a discriminatory effect, may include:\n\nback pay,\nhiring,\npromotion,\nreinstatement,\nfront pay,\nreasonable accommodation, or\nother actions that will make an individual ""whole"" (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimination).\nRemedies also may include payment of:\n\nattorneys' fees,\nexpert witness fees, and\ncourt costs.\nUnder most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and punitive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is found. Damages may be available to compensate for actual monetary losses, for future monetary losses, and for mental anguish and inconvenience. Punitive damages also may be available if an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. Punitive damages are not available against the federal, state or local governments.\n\nIn cases concerning reasonable accommodation under the ADA, compensatory or punitive damages may not be awarded to the charging party if an employer can demonstrate that ""good faith"" efforts were made to provide reasonable accommodation.\n\nAn employer may be required to post notices to all employees addressing the violations of a specific charge and advising them of their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliation. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilities that affect reading.\n\nThe employer also may be required to take corrective or preventive actions to cure the source of the identified discrimination and minimize the chance of its recurrence, as well as discontinue the specific discriminatory practices involved in the case.\n\nThe Commission\n\nXIV. What Is EEOC and How Does It Operate?\n\nEEOC is an independent federal agency originally created by Congress in 1964 to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Commission is composed of five Commissioners and a General Counsel appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Commissioners are appointed for five-year staggered terms; the General Counsel's term is four years. The President designates a Chair and a Vice-Chair. The Chair is the chief executive officer of the Commission. The Commission has authority to establish equal employment policy and to approve litigation.

The law protects not only people who belong to traditional, organized religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, but also others who have sincerely held religious, ethical or moral beliefs.\n\nReligious discrimination can also involve treating someone differently because that person is married to (or associated with) an individual of a particular religion or because of his or her connection with a religious organization or group.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Work Situations\nThe law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Harassment\nIt is illegal to harass a person because of his or her religion.\n\nHarassment can include, for example, offensive remarks about a person’s religious beliefs or practices. Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that aren’t very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).\n\nThe harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer.\n\nReligious Discrimination and Segregation\nTitle VII also prohibits workplace or job segregation based on religion (including religious garb and grooming practices), such as assigning an employee to a non-customer contact position because of actual or feared customer preference.\nReligious Discrimination & Reasonable Accommodation\nThe law requires an employer or other covered entity to reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would cause more than a minimal burden on the operations of the employer's business. This means an employer may be required to make reasonable adjustments to the work environment that will allow an employee to practice his or her religion.\n\nExamples of some common religious accommodations include flexible scheduling, voluntary shift substitutions or swaps, job reassignments, and modifications to workplace policies or practices.\n\nReligious Accommodation/Dress & Grooming Policies\nUnless it would be an undue hardship on the employer's operation of its business, an employer must reasonably accommodate an employee's religious beliefs or practices. This applies not only to schedule changes or leave for religious observances, but also to such things as dress or grooming practices that an employee has for religious reasons. These might include, for example, wearing particular head coverings or other religious dress (such as a Jewish yarmulke or a Muslim headscarf), or wearing certain hairstyles or facial hair (such as Rastafarian dreadlocks or Sikh uncut hair and beard). It also includes an employee's observance of a religious prohibition against wearing certain garments (such as pants or miniskirts).\n\nWhen an employee or applicant needs a dress or grooming accommodation for religious reasons, he should notify the employer that he needs such an accommodation for religious reasons. If the employer reasonably needs more information, the employer and the employee should engage in an interactive process to discuss the request. If it would not pose an undue hardship, the employer must grant the accommodation.\n\nReligious Discrimination & Reasonable Accommodation & Undue Hardship\nAn employer does not have to accommodate an employee’s religious beliefs or practices if doing so would cause undue hardship to the employer. An accommodation may cause undue hardship if it is costly, compromises workplace safety, decreases workplace efficiency, infringes on the rights of other employees, or requires other employees to do more than their share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work.\n\nReligious Discrimination And Employment Policies/Practices\nAn employee cannot be forced to participate (or not participate) in a religious activity as a condition of employment.",,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,

Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Anti-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of these laws.\n\nPetty slights, annoyances, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not rise to the level of illegality. To be unlawful, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people.\n\nOffensive conduct may include, but is not limited to, offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, offensive objects or pictures, and interference with work performance. Harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nThe harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, an agent of the employer, a co-worker, or a non-employee.\nThe victim does not have to be the person harassed, but can be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.\nUnlawful harassment may occur without economic injury to, or discharge of, the victim.\nPrevention is the best tool to eliminate harassment in the workplace. Employers are encouraged to take appropriate steps to prevent and correct unlawful harassment. They should clearly communicate to employees that unwelcome harassing conduct will not be tolerated. They can do this by establishing an effective complaint or grievance process, providing anti-harassment training to their managers and employees, and taking immediate and appropriate action when an employee complains. Employers should strive to create an environment in which employees feel free to raise concerns and are confident that those concerns will be addressed.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to inform the harasser directly that the conduct is unwelcome and must stop. Employees should also report harassment to management at an early stage to prevent its escalation.",,,,,0,,Harassment Type,,,,,,,,,

Resolution of the Complaint\nFailure to Resolve the Dispute\nThe aggrieved person may not be satisfied with the agency's proposed resolution of the dispute, or the agency officials may not agree to the aggrieved person's suggestions. If informal resolution is not possible, the Counselor must hold a final interview with the aggrieved person within 30 days of the date the aggrieved person brought the dispute to the Counselor's attention, unless the aggrieved person consented to an extension of time, not to exceed 60 days. If the dispute is not resolved at the end of the extended time period, the Counselor must advise the aggrieved party in writing of his/her right to file a complaint.\n\nThe 30-day EEO counseling period (or as extended by agreement of the aggrieved party) commences when the aggrieved person first contacts the EEO Counselor or the appropriate agency office in which the EEO Counselor works and by exhibiting an intent to begin the EEO process. The unavailability of an EEO Counselor to meet with the aggrieved person for a period of time after such initial contact does not toll the 30-day counseling period.
